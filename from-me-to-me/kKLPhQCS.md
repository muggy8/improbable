# Under the Cover of Night

When we finally left the forest, the sun has long since set.

The sky was overcast and the only reliable source of light is the dim infrared heat glow of the 3 of us, barely enough to navigate with.

I thought I had gotten pretty used to the dark nights here but that was clearly not the case.

Yet somehow, despite only being able to see forwards for about 10 or so meters, the 3 of us were making our way home without much trouble. 

I guess Mikay knows the way home quite well.

Though that should be pretty much a given. 

Melody, on the other hand, hasn't said a single word since I gave her the small memorial rock.

She's held on to it tightly and I could see her feeling the groves of the engraved letters again and again despite the letters being being from a writing system that completely differs what's used here.

Though that too is also to be expected.

If it ever came up, I'd like to avoid attending my own funeral or visiting my own tombstone and I'm sure I'm part of the majority in feeling this way.

Even if I had to restart my life again from a digital backup of myself, I'd surely avoid going to see my own funeral even.

Speaking of, I think I remember seeing a backup restore that happened sometime ago in the log files the other day. 

I didn't give it much thought at the time but I guess that means I've died once already technically. 

But the circumstances of that backup restore was rather strange so I guess it doesn't really count as me dying right?

But technically someone's existence did stop when my backup was restored and that person is pretty much me though not exactly me.

Does that mean I should erect a grave stone for myself? 

That thought left me feeling rather uncomfortable. 

While still thinking about this, we ended up arriving at home.

"Lets gets some rest" suggested Mikay and neither of us objected.

Following Mikay's suggestion, I noticed Melody fumbling around to find her way back to her room as if she couldn't see a single thing and is only going around by memory.

Mikay, on the other hand, had no problems navigating though the dimly lit environment where the only source of light was the dim infrared heat glow of our bodies.

I'm sure the 3 of us will have much to discuss once morning comes but until then, I have all the time in the world to my self.

I made my way to my own room as well but I had no intentions of sleeping tonight.

I noticed Cushion in my room under the desk as I entered but I made no attempt to interact with it.

It must be sleeping too. 

Closing the door behind me, I made my way towards the part of the room where I landed when I crashed though the roof.

The hole hasn't be completely fixed but it's definitely much smaller than before. 

Looking though the hole and into the pitch black sky, I bent my knees and jumped out though the hole in the roof. 

Tonight is likely the last night that the 3 of us will be staying here in this settlement so before our departure, there's a few things I want to do.

...

Not long after leaving my room through the roof, I arrived at the place where this whole thing started, the site of Melody's death.

The body has already been cleaned up and not much is left on the ground. 

However, what I was looking for wasn't on the ground but beneath it.

I was looking for Melody's body.

Mikay said something about Melody being able to connect with the dead body's Sphere of Influence when we visited last time.

Though this Sphere of Influence is something I lack, it was still a resource that could be made useful.

Especially because there's no known ways of getting more of it according to Mikay.

And so, I started getting to work.

This wasn't something I could have done because of the investigation going around but now that we're leaving, a bit of grave robbing is probably ok.

I made my way to behind the school, under the place where I was hanging by the roof of during the exam day when I was trying to infiltrate the building.

There was a flower bed growing here and I didn't give it much though at the time but now that I think about it, this must be where the dead is buried.

I stated looking around but I didn't find anything resembling what I was looking for.

But this wasn't the only place I could look.

There was a small trail that lead away from the flower garden.

Following that trail lead me to another flower garden close to the river and I immediately spotted what I was looking for, an area with some flowers sitting on soil that's all too soft.

It was at this place that I started digging and soon enough, I found exactly what I was looking for, the bottom half of a skeleton.

I collected all the bones buried here within a make shift pouch made out of the light leather armor that was buried with the skeleton and made my way home.

There's alot of analysis I would be doing on these bones in the future which is why I needed to collect these while I still had the chance.

After an attempt to return the flower bed to what it was like before I dug it up, I returned home with Melody's skeleton in hand.

When I got home, I wasn't really sure where I would put the bones I just dug up. 

Fortunately, because the bones were picked clean by animals that lived near by, or maybe it was because of the process of disposing of the dead, there wasn't any stench coming from the bones.

Unable to decide, I ended up just shoving them under my bed.

This is something I'll have to consult with Mikay about later when I get the chance.

When everything is said and done, I could see the sky brightening up already.

Normally, I would be in bed by now.

Probably not sleeping but at least resting and maybe trying to work on the Assembler that I'm growing within me. 

But given that this is my last night here, I didn't have the luxury of doing that. 

I didn't know what I would do about my food situation if we were to leave but I would expect some sort of vehicle to be involved. 

But it's rather unlikely that my aquaculture farm would be able to come along with us in the way that it was which was why my next order of business was to pack that up as best as I can before we leave.

I jumped onto the roof through the makeshift skylight, and sat down next to the pond as I connected to the various controllers living within it.

There were alot of bacteria and bio-machinery all living within this tank and most of them are dedicated to food production. 

Since I wouldn't be able to rely on having a pond like this in the future I would need to store as much of this away into a portable form.

With that in mind, I began issuing commands to the various controllers.

Soon enough, almost all the bacteria and bio-machines in the pond gathered into a fluffy flack blanket of sorts.

Mikay and Melody were both starting to wake up by now so I grabbed the blanket and made my way back into my room.

I also took the opportunity to move some of the bacteria and bio-machinery onto my shirt since I had been ripping pieces off of it quite a bit yesterday and I didn't know if I had the time to wait for it to grow back.

This left a strange patch of black all around my shirt that faded into the rest of the shirt.

Honestly, it looked kinda cool but I'm sure I'd get sick of it pretty soon.

After wrapping up Melody's bones in the blanket that I just made, I headed outside and sat at the table waiting for Mikay and Melody to wake up.

Of course, I would love to be sleeping right now but that's not something I could think about doing right now as a rather difficult conversation will soon be had between Mikay, Melody and I.
