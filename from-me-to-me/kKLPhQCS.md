# Epilogue

When we finally left the forest, the sun has long since set.

The sky was overcast and the only reliable source of light is the dim infrared heat glow of the 3 of us, barely enough to navigate with.

I thought I had gotten pretty used to the dark nights here but that was clearly not the case.

Yet somehow, despite only being able to see forwards for about 10 or so meters, the 3 of us were making our way home without much trouble. 

I guess Mikay knows the way home quite well.

Though that should be pretty much a given. 

Melody, on the other hand, hasn't said a single word since I gave her the small memorial rock.

She's held on to it tightly and I could see her feeling the groves of the engraved letters again and again despite the letters being being from a writing system that completely differs what's used here.

Though that too is also to be expected.

If it ever came up, I'd like to avoid attending my own funeral or visiting my own tombstone and I'm sure I'm part of the majority in feeling this way.

Even if I had to restart my life again from a digital backup of myself, I'd surely avoid going to see my own funeral even.

Speaking of, I think I remember seeing a backup restore that happened sometime ago in the log files the other day. 

I didn't give it much thought at the time but I guess that means I've died once already technically. 

But the circumstances of that backup restore was rather strange so I guess it doesn't really count as me dying right?

But technically someone's existence did stop when my backup was restored and that person is pretty much me though not exactly me.

Does that mean I should erect a grave stone for myself? 

That thought left me feeling rather uncomfortable. 

While still thinking about this, we ended up arriving at home.

"Lets gets some rest" suggested Mikay and neither of us objected.

Following Mikay's suggestion, I noticed Melody fumbling around to find her way back to her room as if she couldn't see a single thing and is only going around by memory.

Mikay, on the other hand, had no problems navigating though the dimly lit environment where the only source of light was the dim infrared heat glow of our bodies.

I'm sure the 3 of us will have much to discuss once morning comes but until then, I have all the time in the world to my self.

I made my way to my own room as well but I had no intentions of sleeping tonight.

I noticed Cushion in my room under the desk as I entered but I made no attempt to interact with it.

It must be sleeping too. 

Closing the door behind me, I made my way towards the part of the room where I landed when I crashed though the roof.

The hole hasn't be completely fixed but it's definitely much smaller than before. 

Looking though the hole and into the pitch black sky, I bent my knees and jumped out though the hole in the roof. 

Tonight is likely the last night that the 3 of us will be staying here in this settlement so before our departure, there's a few things I want to do.
