# Under the Cover of Night

When we finally left the forest, the sun has long since set.

The sky was overcast and the only reliable source of light is the dim infrared heat glow of the 3 of us, barely enough to navigate with.

I thought I had gotten pretty used to the dark nights here but that was clearly not the case.

Yet somehow, despite only being able to see forwards for about 10 or so meters, the 3 of us were making our way home without much trouble. 

I guess Mikay knows the way home quite well.

Though that should be pretty much a given. 

Melody, on the other hand, hasn't said a single word since I gave her the small memorial rock.

She's held on to it tightly and I could see her feeling the groves of the engraved letters again and again despite the letters being being from a writing system that completely differs what's used here.

Though that too is also to be expected.

If it ever came up, I'd like to avoid attending my own funeral or visiting my own tombstone and I'm sure I'm part of the majority in feeling this way.

Even if I had to restart my life again from a digital backup of myself, I'd surely avoid going to see my own funeral even.

Speaking of, I think I remember seeing a backup restore that happened sometime ago in the log files the other day. 

I didn't give it much thought at the time but I guess that means I've died once already technically. 

But the circumstances of that backup restore was rather strange so I guess it doesn't really count as me dying right?

But technically someone's existence did stop when my backup was restored and that person is pretty much me though not exactly me.

Does that mean I should erect a grave stone for myself? 

That thought left me feeling rather uncomfortable. 

While still thinking about this, we ended up arriving at home.

"Lets gets some rest" suggested Mikay and neither of us objected.

Following Mikay's suggestion, I noticed Melody fumbling around to find her way back to her room as if she couldn't see a single thing and is only going around by memory.

Mikay, on the other hand, had no problems navigating though the dimly lit environment where the only source of light was the dim infrared heat glow of our bodies.

I'm sure the 3 of us will have much to discuss once morning comes but until then, I have all the time in the world to my self.

I made my way to my own room as well but I had no intentions of sleeping tonight.

I noticed Cushion in my room under the desk as I entered but I made no attempt to interact with it.

It must be sleeping too. 

Closing the door behind me, I made my way towards the part of the room where I landed when I crashed though the roof.

The hole hasn't be completely fixed but it's definitely much smaller than before. 

Looking though the hole and into the pitch black sky, I bent my knees and jumped out though the hole in the roof. 

Tonight is likely the last night that the 3 of us will be staying here in this settlement so before our departure, there's a few things I want to do.

...

Not long after leaving my room through the roof, I arrived at the place where this whole thing started, the site of Melody's death.

The body has already been cleaned up and not much is left on the ground. 

A single glance was all it took for me to realize that what I was looking for was no longer there.

I made my way to behind the school, under the place where I was hanging by the roof of during the exam day when I was trying to infiltrate the building.

There was a flower bed growing here and I didn't give it much though at the time but now that I think about it, this must be where the dead is buried.

Mikay said something about Melody being able to connect with the dead body's Sphere of Influence when we visited last time.

Though this Sphere of Influence is something I lack, it was still a resource that could be made useful.

Especially because there's no known ways of getting more of it according to Mikay.

And if Melody can make use of this Sphere of Influence thing from the corpse of the departed Melody, then the only reasonable thing to do is to collect Melody's remains before we leave.

And so, I started getting to work searching for what remained of Melody.

But somehow, my body felt sluggish.

As if it refused to listen to my will.

This wasn't something I would have done by myself.

If there's anyone who has the right to do something like this then it's Melody herself.

Yet here I am digging up her grave and collecting her remains.

This act felt wrong to me, every part of doing this went against my morals and what I believed in.

The dead should be Respected, the dead should be remembered. 

What I'm doing right now is no better than reanimating the dead.

Yet despite that, I must still continue, without much success.

What normally would have taken me at most half an hour to do felt like it was taking me much much longer.

It wasn't just that, every move I made was full of hesitation.

Despite the amount of time I spent searching, there was a clear lack of results. 

Did I spend an hour searching?

Maybe 2 hours?

Despite the time spent searching, I couldn't find anything even resembling what I was looking for.

I wanted to give up, just accept that this was somehow the world telling me that I shouldn't be doing this, but I know better.

Stuff like that doesn't exist. 

It is all just a series of coincidences that is fooling my mind into thinking there's some deeper meaning behind.

That's when I noticed a small trail that lead away from the flower garden.

It seems that this wasn't the only place I could look.

Following that trail lead me to another flower garden close to the river that this settlement uses as it's water.

upon arriving, I immediately spotted what I was looking for, an area with some flowers sitting on soil that's too lose.

It was clear that this place has recently been dug up.

I hesitantly approached the flowers and unease filled my mind.

'This is the right thing to do', I thought to myself

This has to be the right thing to do.

After all, to knowingly throw away something that's useful and irreplaceable is just stupidity at it's finest.

Yet even still, I hesitated.

Digging up this grave means that I'm denying someone's existence, destroying their legacy, invalidating the life that they've lived.

It doesn't matter that another Melody that shared a past with this Melody is still alive and well.

This Melody that was in the ground had lived her life and her story was over.

The changes she made in the world, the changes that she left though her existence.

In essence, I was altering the memory of the world.

I was altering her existence, killing a dead person again. 

I didn't want to do that.

Everyone has the right to remain dead.

Everyone has the right to be remembered. 

Even if someone is only remembered in a physical way by what was left of them after their death, that is still a way that the world is remembering them.

Yet here I am, looking at such a grave with the intent of destroying the physical memory of Melody.

I didn't what to do it yet not doing it would be beyond foolish.

Hesitantly I lowered myself to the ground in preparation to excavate the flower bed.

"What's right isn't always what's best" I whispered to myself as if I trying to convince myself.

"What's right isn't always what's best" I whispered again.

"What's right isn't always what's best" I whispered once more.

And slowly, at this place, I started digging and soon enough, I found exactly what I was expecting to find, the bottom half of a skeleton.

"What's right isn't always what's best. What's right isn't always what's best"

I collected all the bones buried here within a make shift pouch made out of the light leather armor that was buried with the skeleton and made my way home.

There's a ton of analysis I would be doing on these bones in the future which is why I needed to collect these while I still had the chance.

"What's right isn't always what's best... What's right isn't always what's best... What's right isn't always what's best"

I tried to convince myself that what I was doing was ok. 

Digging up the grave, collecting the bones, no matter how much I try to reason with myself, my heart ached every time my hand touched the bones before me.

"What's right isn't always what's best... What's right isn't always what's best..."

I could feel my hands trembling as I made an attempt to return the flower bed to what it was like before I dug it up.

There's no reason to feel so dirty about what I have done, yet I couldn't shake this feeling of discomfort as I returned home with Melody's remains in hand.

When I got home, I knew I needed to keep them out of sight, yet I wasn't really sure where I would put the bones I just dug up. 

Fortunately, because the bones were picked clean by animals that lived near by, or maybe it was because of the process of disposing of the dead, there wasn't any stench coming from the bones.

Unable to decide, I ended up just shoving them under my bed.

This is something I'll have to consult with Mikay about later when I get the chance.

When everything is said and done, I could see the sky brightening up already.

Normally, I would be in bed by now.

Probably not sleeping but at least resting and maybe trying to work on the Assembler that I'm growing within me. 

Unfortunately, today's not just any ordinary day.

I jumped though the hole in the roof of my room once more to visit the growth pond on the roof of the house.

It was filled to the brim with organic machines.

Mikay was filled with disgust upon seeing this during the few times that he's been up here.

Not that I can really fault him for that.

It really does look unpleasant even if I know basically exactly what it is and have full control over it. 

Fortunately, it doesn't produce any unpleasant odours so no one around is really bothered by it as long as they aren't looking at it.

_Notice: Connected to BlackPond_

Upon walking up to the pond, the usual connection success signal sounded off in my mind.

As soon as this happened, I began sending commands for the bacteria living in the pond to execute.

"BlackPond status"

_BlackPond: Bio Status: healthy_<br/>
_BlackPond: Command Nodes 2%_<br/>
_BlackPond: Running Tasks: 8_<br/>
_BlackPond: ..._<br/>

Various information about the pond was being communicated to my mind and nothing out of the ordinary seemed to be happening, just as I had expected.

"BlackPond supplement Outfit -priority 0"<br/>
"Outfit set design dress22"

After issuing the commands to reconstitute my shirt into a dress by using the bacterial machinery in the pond, I stepped into the pond myself to begin the process of converting my outfit.

Laying in the pond, I had the sudden realization. 

The goop around me felt almost just like Pillow and Cushion, except much bigger.

It was a strange feeling but one that I don't dislike.

Though I don't know exactly what is going to happen once we depart, I would definitely like to take as much of the bacterial machinery in this pond with me.

That's why I ended up choosing a dress with a design that was complicated with many frills and folds.

The color wont be changed that easily but it's nothing a little structural coloring cant fix.

Looking up at the orange sky of dawn, The tiredness from the days before finally hit me and I started drifting off to sleep.

...

...

...

...

"Phanna... doing... ... ... alive? ..."

An annoying voice interrupted my peaceful rest as I was forced to open my eyes.

"Phanna you ok there?"

The blurry image of Mikay loomed over my head as I slowly regained consciousness.

"I was pretty ok for a good while. But then this person started yelling at me to wake up." I replied feeling a bit frustrated.

"Oh, I see. I guess you're fine then."

"Well, since you're here anyways, why not give me a bit of help."

"What do you need?"

"That quicken thing that you did yesterday with the bowl of water and a piece of my shirt, think you can do that again?"

"Uh, I can. But what do you need that for?"

"Do you want me to explain?"

"...No. So where do you want me to do use Quicken?"

"This whole pond. I'll let you know when you can stop."

"Um. sure thing I guess."

After Mikay answered, the world around me began to slow down.

The trees that were supposed to be moving in the air slowed, the leaf blowing in the wind slowed, the sounds coming from my surroundings dropped in pitch significantly.

A suspended world like this was a perfect way for me to extend my sleep.

Once again I gazed into the frozen sky and drifted off.

...

...

...

I woke up later and the Sun had barely moved.

Mikay was sitting around as well.

I looked down my body to see my frilly dress fully formed.

The pond I was resting in was no longer as black as it once was since much of the bacteria that were living in it are now attached to my outfit.

Feeling satisfied, I called out to Mikay but he didn't respond.

It seems like he didn't accelerate himself.

I guess that's alright.

I grabbed a hand full of water and threw it at Mikay.

I'm sure he'll understand but until then, I'll have to wait.

After what felt like a couple minutes, Mikay finally began to move.

And then he sped up, and sped up, and sped up...

"Phanna! What the heck!" Mikay yelled angrily.

"How else am I supposed to get your attention?"

"How in the world am I supposed to get this dirty much out of my cloths now?"

"Oh I'll take care of that"

I reached out to the spots where I had splashed Mikay, held part of my dress over it, and issued my command

"Outfit collect"

...

_Notice: Outfit: Collection complete_

Upon receiving the signal, removed my skirt from Mikay's clothing and all that's left on it was a bit of water.

Mikay was rather surprised by the results and let out a sigh.

"Lets go back inside."

Upon making that suggestion, I stood up from the pond.

Mikay also stood up shortly after and the both of us return to the building.

This time, we entered from the front door instead of jumping though the hole in the roof.
