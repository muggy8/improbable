# The Only Path

When we finally left the forest, the sun has long since set.

The sky was overcast and the only reliable source of light is the dim infrared heat glow of the 3 of us, barely enough to navigate with.

I thought I had gotten pretty used to the dark nights here but that was clearly not the case.

Yet somehow, despite only being able to see forwards for about 10 or so meters, the 3 of us were making our way home without much trouble. 

I guess Mikay knows the way home quite well.

Though that should be pretty much a given. 

Melody, on the other hand, hasn't said a single word since I gave her the small memorial rock.

She's held on to it tightly and I could see her feeling the groves of the engraved letters again and again despite the letters being being from a writing system that completely differs what's used here.

Though that too is also to be expected.
