# Meal Time

By the time Mikay returned, the sun was getting close to setting. 

Phanna has yet to leave the barrel of water and I found myself inside the room with the glass box hugging the squishy blob.

The blob seemed to be a living thing and would sometimes wiggle away while other times, it would come close to me. 

I didn't know what it was but I had gathered it was Mikay's pet of sorts. 

It is defnately not any type of pet that I've seen and seemed to serve no purpose unlike the scouting hawks or hunting dogs the elven tribes had.

I guess someone as powerful as Mikay wouldn't have to choose pets based on anything other than weather the pet was likeable or not.

"Oh, you've taken a liking to Pillow too it seems" Said Mikay when he saw me curling up around the blob.

"At least you're more gentle with it than Phanna is."

There was blood splattered across Mikay's body and cloths.

Based on that, I could tell he was out hunting something.

Soon enough, the blob named Pillow slid out of my grasp and wiggled itself toward Mikay who then picked it up as it aproached.

I watched Mikay put Pillow back into the aquarium and before leaving the room.

Before long, Phanna returned to my room wearing slightly damp cloathing.

"That Mikay, cutting into my relaxation time..." Phanna  growled.

"Do you... not get along with Master Mikay?" I asked.

Phanna looked at me seemingly a bit surprised before answering.

"Well, I wouldn't say that, But I think it's a probably mostly a difference in our world views and values."

Different values?

That was something I have always heard about but never truly understood.

The elven colony functioned as a collective, everyone worked hard for the greater good of the group.

We would often fight other groups or tribes for resources and control over land but fighting over something as simple as beliefs were a strange concept for me.

A fight isn't something that you do for fun, and the cost of engaging in a fight is often quite heavy for both parties involved.

That's why I didn't quite understand this action that other humanoids engaged in.

"Do you fight with Master Mikay over these issues simple difference often?" I asked trying to further understand this strange behaviour.

"Fight? Well I wouldn't call what we're doing fighting but more of giving voice to our differing values."

Phanna's answer still left me confused but it also gave me a slight feeling of relief knowing that they weren't well and truly fighting.

If someone like Phanna and Master Mikay faught, who would have known what kind of damages would result.
