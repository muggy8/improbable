# Time

By the time Mikay returned, the sun was getting close to setting. 

Phanna has yet to leave the barrel of water and I found myself inside the room with the glass box hugging the squishy blob.

The blob seemed to be a living thing and would sometimes wiggle away while other times, it would come close to me. 

I didn't know what it was but I had gathered it was Mikay's pet of sorts. 

It is definitely not any type of pet that I've seen and seemed to serve no purpose unlike the scouting hawks or hunting dogs the elven tribes had.

I guess someone as powerful as Mikay wouldn't have to choose pets based on anything other than weather the pet was likable or not.

"Oh, you've taken a liking to Pillow too it seems" Said Mikay when he saw me curling up around the blob.

"At least you're more gentle with it than Phanna is."

There was blood splattered across Mikay's body and cloths.

Based on that, I could tell he was out hunting something.

Soon enough, the blob named Pillow slid out of my grasp and wiggled itself toward Mikay who then picked it up as it approached.

I watched Mikay put Pillow back into the aquarium and before leaving the room.

Before long, Phanna returned to my room wearing slightly damp clothing.

"That Mikay, cutting into my relaxation time..." Phanna  growled.

"Do you... not get along with Master Mikay?" I asked.

Phanna looked at me seemingly a bit surprised before answering.

"Well, I wouldn't say that, But I think it's a probably mostly a difference in our world views and values."

Different values?

That was something I have always heard about but never truly understood.

The elven colony functioned as a collective, everyone worked hard for the greater good of the group.

We would often fight other groups or tribes for resources and control over land but fighting over something as simple as beliefs were a strange concept for me.

A fight isn't something that you do for fun, and the cost of engaging in a fight is often quite heavy for both parties involved.

That's why I didn't quite understand this action that other humanoids engaged in.

"Do you fight with Master Mikay over these issues simple difference often?" I asked trying to further understand this strange behavior.

"Fight? Well I wouldn't call what we're doing 'fighting' but more of giving voice to our differing values."

"Does this often happen?"

"Hmm... well... I guess it does."

"Why would you do that? It's like you're trying to get on  Mikay's bad side..."

"It's more like Mikay is actively trying to  get on my bad side and I'm just giving him a piece of my mind."

"R-really? Aren't you scared of Mikay?"

"Scared? of what?"

"You know, he's a Master and all. If he really wanted to, he'd probably be able to kill you without..."

I found myself going quiet when I realized what I just said.

Phanna doesn't care about dying, in fact, he's actively trying to do that... Just like me...

Saying that something is life threatening to him probably doesn't mean anything to him at all...

Yet even knowing this and feeling the way that I do, I doubt I'd be doing what Phanna's doing.

Why is that?

What makes us so different?

Does that really mean that Phanna has fully given up and I haven't?

But what pushes me forwards?

What is it that keeps me clining on to life?

As if noticing my inner troubles, Phanna swung his arm over my shoulders.

"You don't have to worry about me." Phanna said after swinging his arm over me.

The giant rips in the flesh of his arms was right next to me in clear view.

If the blood on his wounds weren't dry, I'm dure my light hunting armor would be stained by it now.

Just looking at the injury hurts.

Yet Phanna here doesn't give the slightest thought to that and is prioritizing me above his own injuries.

If our roles were reverse, would I have done the same?

What could have happened to cause this?

Am I nothing but a week imitation of Phanna in my conviction, determination and my skills.

Why am I even jealous of Phanna in this reguard?

As I drowned myself in these thoughts, I couldn't help but to look away at Phanna and instead at the glass box in which I awakened in earlier in an attept to distract me from my own thoughts.

"Tell me, how do you think Amada would feel if you died?" Phanna asked catching me by surprise.

"I-I don't know... She probably wouldn't care too much... Afterall, I was a burden to her... no, I was a burden to everyone..."

"How sure are you of this?"

"I'm..."

I wanted to say that I was really sure, yet somehow, those words wong leave my mouth as I stuttered.

Instead all that came though was silence.

But why?

My worthlessness was the only thing I though I could be sure about yet here I am hesitating again.

Why do I stumble on my words?

Why does my intuition argue against my logic?

Why is silence the only thing that leaves my mouth?

"W-why are you asking?" I asked instead as I found myself unable to answer Phanna's question.

Phanna, for his part, seemed rather unsure of how to answer my question for a brief moment but somehow came to a conclusion.

"You see, I've already killed you once." said Phanna as he removed his arm that was wrapped around my shoulder.

"I'm sure you remember this too. When you kicked me during the exam."

I gave Phanna a light nod.

"You see, i'm not exactly sure what happened in your past but in my past, I threw you into the solid rock platform and the upper half of your body basically distintigrated upon hitting the rock."

I froze up at Phanna's words.

I... died?

B-but yet... 

"You must have quite a bit of questions right? Why do I exist right now? Are you telling the truth? What happened to me after? Did I guess correctly?"

I flet myself giving Phanna a frightful nod.

"Honestly, I don't really want to believe this myself but, like me, it seems like you came from a different timeline than the current timeline we're in."

"Timelines?"

Phanna gave me a chuckle but continued on.

"When there's a road that splits into two paths, you can say both the left and the right path both came from the same path right? Like wise, time is like a branching road, the past is the road that leads in to the split, now is the point at where the split hapenes, and the future is the differnet paths that leads from the road. let say I came from the left path where you died and you came from the right path where you didn't."

"B-but I can only travel one path right?"

"No, you never went down either paths. You and I are meerly the dirt that the road is made of."

None of what Phanna said makes sense. 

I returned a confused look to Phanna but, as if reading my mind, Phanna just replied with.

"Wanna see proof?"

Do I?

What is this uneasy feeling I feel?

Where is it coming from?

Yet I couldn't help but to wonder, what proof does Phanna have?

Before I know it, I was giving Phanna a nod.

It was a weak and frightful nod, but a nod none the less.

Seeing this, Phanna stood up and made his way to leave the room.

"Come with me."

All I could do was to follow Phanna's command and stood up.

"Mikay, we're heading out for a bit. We'll be back shortly." Phanna shouted as we made our way past the bathroom.

"What?! Where are you going?!"

"For a walk"

"NO! You are in no condition to do anything of the sort. Stop! No!"

I didn't say a word during this exchange, or more accurately, couldn't say a single world during this exchange.
