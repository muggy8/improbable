# Exit

I left the my room with Phanna beside me.

For some reason, I didn't notice this until now but Phanna's not wearing his usual breezy outfit but is instead, wearing a dress.

The dress itself looked like it had multiple layers.

The upper part of the dress resembled the normal shirt he'd wear all the time.

However, the sleeves were much longer and flared out at the end resulting in what looks like a big flap wrapped around his arms.

I could hardly believe that the Phanna I know would wear something like this.

"Um... What are you wearing?" I asked hesitantly

"The same thing I always wear." Phanna answered.

"There's no way. It looks nothing like what you normally wear." I pouted.

But Phanna just simply lifted the dress up.

"See the same shorts I always wear."

I could feel Mikay slapping his forehead with his palm a couple seconds after Phanna did this.

"What are you doing you fool!" Mikay exclaimed.

"Providing proof that I'm wearing the same thing I always wear."

"Stop. Just stop. Lower your dress and sit down. Melody your food is on the table."

At Mikay's command, both Phanna and I sat down by the table.

I quietly started eating the food before me as Mikay and Phanna started taking.

"Aright, Melody's up now, what's next?" Phanna asked.

"we're going to have to pack everything we're going to want to keep into her room and then after that, we'll leave." Mikay replied.

"I see, I see. I'll need a box then." Phanna replied as if thinking about something.

"What kind of box?"

"Something that can be used to carry fragile things."

"Hmm... wouldn't a bag be better then?"

"True... But I don't really expect that I'll be unpacking it any time soon and it's easier to store when its in a box."

"Is that so. Maybe you can just store it with the cloths?"

"Uhh... I think that's probably not the best thing to do..."

"Um... What are you guys talking about?" I asked a bit confused by what's going on.

Mikay looked towards my direction as Phanna just sighed.

"Mikay you explain this."

"Melody, we have to leave Mountainpass."

"What?! Why?"

"It's one of the conditions the elves demanded for stopping the fight yesterday. We had to leave Mountainpass today or earlier."

"W-What? Why?"

"It seems that they think Phanna is something called a Queen it's impossible to convince them otherwise."

"That's... Understandable" I said looking down at my plate of half finished food.

I thought the same thing once.

Phanna looked like a pregnant queen and he still does even now.

In fact, the dress makes him look even more like a pregnant Queen.

But that's not something I could say.

"That's why they demanded that we leave the Mountainpass area since they think that if we don't they'd have to clash against Phanna's children in the future."

"I... See..."

That makes total sense.

If I was in the position of Patrisha, I'd also demand the same.

In fact, even now, I still cant shake the feeling that Phanna is actually a Queen.

He might not look like a Queen or even fully female for that matter.

But there's no denying that his belly is bulging in a strange way not too dissimilar to a Pregnancy.

Yet even so, Mikay and Phanna both insist that that's not the case. 

And not only that, according to Mikay even Ethan, the school Principal who specialize in healing, could not locate any reproductive organs within Phanna.

I've decided to just accept their statements as fact but I still cant really shake the feeling that I'm missing something.

"Um... Where are we going then?"

"Upstream" answered Mikay.

"Downstream" Phanna replied at the same time.

"Look here. We're going upstream. We're still in the middle of summer If we go upstream, the air will be much cooler."

"Ya I know you like this area and what not, but if we leave here, we should try to go somewhere with more people right?"

"And how would you know that going downstream will be where we find more people? Besides. Even if we do find another village, there's no knowing that they'll accept us just moving in."

"No problem, we can just talk to them. You're supposed to be a Master or something right? shouldn't you have some sway over others?"

"Aren't you taking things too lightly? I'm a Master yes,  but it's highly likely that another Village will also have a Master or two living there like is the case with Ethan and I here."

"So? I'm pretty sure I can take you on in a fight if it came down to it." Phanna replied smugly.

"Right... How are you going to do it with no Abilities at all?"

"You say you're about a couple hundred times stronger than the guys chasing me around yesterday right? I might not be able to hurt you much but I should be able to hold my own."

"you sure are confident for someone dressed like that."

"Look. I'm saying that as a last resort, I don't feel like I'd be outmatched. And the goal isn't even to get into a fight in the first place. It's to convince them to let us stay with them."

"That's assuming we're able to find anther Village first."

"We definitely will. Statistically, settlements are often built along a river and larger ones are often built around the mouth of rivers. Bonus points if there's a river delta."

"You're not going to convince me with your fancy words."

"I guess I was expecting too much from you." Phanna sighed.

"Conversation over. We're going upstream."

"No, we're going downstream."

"Why are you so stubborn?!"

"I could ask you the same question."

By this time, I've already finished eating my food so I slowly left the table to put the dish away.

I didn't really want to be part of this discussion but I was a bit jealous at Phanna.

Regardless of how strong he is or if he can fight on even terms with Mikay, he's able to speak his mind and argue for what he believes in.

Though even when he's arguing, he doesn't sound angry or upset. 

Instead, he just sound disappointing.

I left the living room where Phanna and Mikay are arguing and went back into my room where Pillow and Cushion are. 

I tried to pick them up but as soon as I grabbed one of them, I pulled my hand back.

They are still cold from when Phanna cooled them down.

I could tell they don't really like the feeling of being so cold.

They're hardly moving if at all and when they do move, it's in a very slow way.

Feeling sorry for the slimes, I sat down next to one of them and activated my Heat ability around the area of the slime.

It didn't take long for what felt like a miracle and one of them started to jiggle.

Feeling a bit happy about this, I placed my hand on the slime and stopped my heat ability.

The slime still felt cool but it was no longer uncomfortable to touch.

After confirming this, I scooted over to the other slime and did the same thing.
