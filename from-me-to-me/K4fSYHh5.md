# Pregnency?

It's been almost 2 weeks since I started living with Master Mikay and Mr. Phanna, life has been rather dull in a good way.

Every morning, would practice my Abilities with Mikay untill Phanna wakes up.

Of course, I didn't improve one bit even with Mikay's assistance.

Phanna's healing ability seems to be pretty increadible too.

It hasn't even been 2 weeks yet somehow, Phanna's arms look to be almost fully healed. 

In fact, Phanna seemed to be using his arms as normal since day 6 of healing. 

I wonder what is Phanna's secret that lets him pull off this kind of recovery.

The roof of Mikay's home seemed to have been converted into a pool for Pillow as well but Pillow hasn't touched it at all.

Phanna said something about growing food in there but it felt somewhat strange.

I knew about this practice phanna calls 'Agriculture' but I've never really performed it or seen it myself. 

All I know is the tribe seems to dislike the practice and tries to rely on it as little as possiable.

I've been curious about how it works ever since the day Phanna started eating strange looking food he'd fish out of the roof pond but I never really worked up the courage to ask.

Phanna is prone to giving strange explanations as I have learned but I let my curiosity get the better of me too often.

Phanna seems to enjoy this as well and tries his best to explain things in a way I would understand.

That said, Phanna does have some very strange beliefs.

I remember once he said that Karma doesn't exist and all of it is just made up or coincidences.

I tried argueing against Phanna's beliefs but it never got anywhere.

There's no way such a foundational piece of the world is just made up.

Phanna, of course, disagreed.

That said, Phanna does seem to know a lot and is capable of some pretty unbelieveable things and all without using abilities at all.

Just yesterday, Phanna suggested that I change my appearance starting from changing my hair color or something and gave us a recepie of some kind. 

Mikay was doubtful of the suggestion but he's out gathering ingrediants today anyways.

Sometimes, seeing the two makes me wonder if Phanna is actually much more powerful than Mikay.

Yet I know that Phanna doesn't have a Sphere of Influence at all which means Master Mikay must be stronger.

It sure is strange living with these two.

With Mikay out gathering ingrediants, I've been left alone with Phanna today.

"Um... what's that?" I asked looking at the strange looking food on Phanna's food tray unable to resist my curiosity.

"Oh this? it's salmon. since I can't really cook or anything, I've been farming thing; I could eat raw."

"S-salmon? Can you grow stuff like that?" I asked in surprise as Phanna peeled some black looking blob.

Indeed, the contents under the black skin does indeed look like salmon meat but the blob itself looks nothing like the fish.

"Wanna try some?" Phanna asked.

I wanted to answer yes but I was also hesitant.

Almost everything Phanna does feels like black magic to me and this food was no diffenent.

When I ask for an explanation, the answeres only causes more confusion.

Do I really want to partake in something so mysterious? 

Will it affect my Karma?

There must be a reason the colony tried to avoid this agricuture thing if possable yet here Phanna is doing it like it's nothing.

Phanna peeled another one of the blobs and ate it.

"It tastes really good. Your loss if you don't wanna try." Phanna taunted. 

"Um... How exactly is it made?" I asked cautiously.

Phanna paused at my question which I assumed means he's thinking about how to answer my question,

"This is made by growing animal meat using sunlight?"

"And how exactly does that work?" I asked suspiciousely.

Again, Phanna paused to think about the answer before trying to answer.

"It... um... uses sunlight to convert parts of air into sugars and protiens then uses those sugars and protiens to build the animal meat?"

"Lets put asside the idea that you can turn air into something else for a second here, what exactly is sugar and protien?" I continued.

"Um... uhh..."

Phanna was stuck trying to give an answer and strugled to come up with something to say.

"Um... to answer that, we need to start at the cell..." Phanna tried to explain but I ended up cutting him off.

"Right right, you said something about this 'Cell' thing being the basis of all life or something like that but what exactly is a cell? How does it work? What does it do? Where did it come from? What does it look like? How do you know this? You never answer these questions properly..."

"Uh... Um... It's hard to explain" Phanna replied.

"All it looks like to me is black magic... you got Mikay to cut a piece of your shirt off and threw it into the pond. The next day, the pond turned black and somhow, some days after, you started eating these strange pods that you'd fetch from the pond. I can't call that anything than black magic now can I?"

"For starters, you can call it science." Phanna joked.

But that just got me more annoyed.

"Well I take it you don't want any then?"

Hesitantly, I gave him a head shake in response.

It's not that I don't want to try, in fact, I'm dying to try some.

From the looks of it, it definately looks like real salmon.

But no matter how much I want to know and how much I want to try, I just can't accept something as suspicious as this.

I have to control myself, don't let this turn into another situation where my curiosity gets the better of me and I end up ruining something.

Seeing this, Phanna directed their attention back at the food tray and finished off the rest of the strange blobs before leaving to dump skin of whatever that was back into the pond.

Shortly after, Mikay came home with a pouch full of stuff.

"I think I got everything you asked for" Mikay said placing the bag on the living room table; the same table we do everything on.

"Thanks" Phanna said before he started working on this 'hair dye' thing.
