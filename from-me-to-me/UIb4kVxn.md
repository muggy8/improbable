# Reincounter

"Ugh... You're doing it wrong. You need to focus on feeling everything inside your Sphere of Influence instead of focus on the feeling of one thing inside of it." Mikay instructed.

"S-sorry" I moped

Training has been more or less fruitless ever since we started practicing together.

No matter what I tried and no matter what Mikay said, nothing seemed to help with improving my mastery over Influence Manipulation.

It's not like I didn't understand the basics, I did.

But for some reason, I couldn't perform them accurately.

I didn't know why and neither did Mikay.

This was the third time we were going over the basics because Mikay was convinced I didn't understand them.

I wonder if Phanna will be able to learn Influence Manipulation easily.

Probably will... I thought to myself.

"Try again, feel for what's behind you... good now feel for what's under the table... now don't stop feeling the thing behind you... good... now try to focus on what's to your left... No no no not like that!"

Yup, I screwed up again...

Just as I was about to give up, a knock came from the door.

"Huh?" Mikay murmured in surprise before going to check on who it was.

As for me, I remained in my steat and waited for the visitor to go away in time as I tried to relax a bit from the practice.

"Ah, Master Mikay, I hope I'm not bothering you right now." said the person just beyond the front door.

Just hearing this person's voice sent chills down my spine as I froze in terror unsure what I should do.

After all, to her, I should be dead by now...

"Oh, it's quite alright. I'm not doing anything too much right now. What brings you here miss... um"

"Amanda."

That's right, the girl that's currently speaking with Mikay right now was my sister, Amanda. 

various thoughts flooded my mind as Mikay and amanda made their excange.

should I run?

"Ahh right. How have things been for you lately?"

Should I try to hide in my room?

But that'd draw too much suspicion.

"Things... has been alright. I've been meaning to come by earlier but things has just been so hectic after Melody's passing"

But what if she notices me?

How do I explain this?

"I see... my condolences."

Wait I have red hair now...

But what if she recognizes me despite that?

"No, it's alright, It's just a fact of life for us elves."

Will Phanna be able to explain?

Probably not on that last one.

"I-I see... So what brings you hear today?"

What's more risky, to stand my ground and pretend I don't know her or to try to avoid contact in the first place.

"I'm just here to thank you for protecting us during the exam. Here's some tea that we harvested from the mountains."

No I don't have time to think this through, I need to act fast

"Ah, I see, thanks."

I quickly hid my face behind my face behind my now red hair and assumed a position of what probably looked like meditation. 

"By... by the way... Master Mikay, could I ask you for a small favor?"

I am nothing, I am one with this table, please don't notice my presence. 

"Favor?"

"That's right, it seems the Mastery League's School in Mountainpass has suspended opperation this semester due to the attack and since the exams were interupted part way though, it doesn't look like anyone will be admitted this semester. Would you be able to find it in your hear to teach some of use who you find capable personally?"

"Um..."

"Could you at least consider it Master Mikay?"

"I... Uhh... I guess I'll give it some consideration."

"Thank you very much Master Mikay! Oh by the way, how is Phanna doing? I don't see him around at all..."

"Phanna... is notcturnal... so they're kind of sleeping right now."

"Gasp... The exam must have been extrememly hard for him then..."

"Tell me about it... anyways, Phanna's been sleeping all day. I honestly have no idea what they're doing but I think they're doing alright."

"Ah. I see. that's good to know! Well, I see you have a guest over, I'll be on my way now. I'll see you soon!"
