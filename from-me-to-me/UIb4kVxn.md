"Ugh... You're doing it wrong. You need to focus on feeling everything inside your Sphere of Influence instead of focus on the feeling of one thing inside of it." Mikay instructed.

"S-sorry" I moped

Training has been more or less fruitless ever since we started practicing together.

No matter what I tried and no matter what Mikay said, nothing seemed to help with improving my mastery over Influence Manipulation.

It's not like I didn't understand the basics, I did.

But for some reason, I couldn't perform them accurately.

I didn't know why and neither did Mikay.

This was the third time we were going over the basics because Mikay was convinced I didn't understand them.

I wonder if Phanna will be able to learn Influence Manipulation easily.

Probably will... I thought to myself.

"Try again, feel for what's behind you... good now feel for what's under the table... now don't stop feeling the thing behind you... good... now try to focus on what's to your left... No no no not like that!"

Yup, I screwed up again...

Just as I was about to give up, a knock came from the door.

"Huh?" Mikay murmured in surprise before going to check on who it was.

As for me, I remained in my steat and waited for the visitor to go away in time as I tried to relax a bit from the practice.

"Ah, Master Mikay, I hope I'm not bothering you right now." said the person just beyond the front door.

Just hearing this person's voice sent chills down my spine as I froze in terror unsure what I should do.

After all, to her, I should be dead by now...

"Oh, it's quite alright. I'm not doing anything too much right now. What brings you here miss... um"

"Amanda."

That's right, the girl that's currently speaking with Mikay right now was my sister, Amanda. 

various thoughts flooded my mind as Mikay and amanda made their excange.

should I run?

Should I try to hide in my room?

But that'd draw too much suspicion.

But what if she notices me?

How do I explain this?

Wait I have red hair now...

But what if she recognizes me despite that?

Will Phanna be able to explain?

Probably not on that last one.

What's more risky, to stand my ground and pretend I don't know her or to try to avoid contact in the first place.

No I don't have time to think this through, I need to act fast
