# Reincounter

"Ugh... You're doing it wrong. You need to focus on feeling everything inside your Sphere of Influence instead of focus on the feeling of one thing inside of it." Mikay instructed.

"S-sorry" I moped

Training has been more or less fruitless ever since we started practicing together.

No matter what I tried and no matter what Mikay said, nothing seemed to help with improving my mastery over Influence Manipulation.

It's not like I didn't understand the basics, I did.

But for some reason, I couldn't perform them accurately.

I didn't know why and neither did Mikay.

This was the third time we were going over the basics because Mikay was convinced I didn't understand them.

I wonder if Phanna will be able to learn Influence Manipulation easily.

Probably will... I thought to myself.

"Try again, feel for what's behind you... good now feel for what's under the table... now don't stop feeling the thing behind you... good... now try to focus on what's to your left... No no no not like that!"

Yup, I screwed up again...

Just as I was about to give up, a knock came from the door.

"Huh?" Mikay murmured in surprise before going to check on who it was.

As for me, I remained in my steat and waited for the visitor to go away in time as I tried to relax a bit from the practice.

"Ah, Master Mikay, I hope I'm not bothering you right now." said the person just beyond the front door.

Just hearing this person's voice sent chills down my spine as I froze in terror unsure what I should do.

After all, to her, I should be dead by now...

"Oh, it's quite alright. I'm not doing anything too much right now. What brings you here miss... um"

"Amanda."

That's right, the girl that's currently speaking with Mikay right now was my sister, Amanda. 

various thoughts flooded my mind as Mikay and amanda made their excange.

should I run?

"Ahh right. How have things been for you lately?"

Should I try to hide in my room?

But that'd draw too much suspicion.

"Things... has been alright. I've been meaning to come by earlier but things has just been so hectic after Melody's passing"

But what if she notices me?

How do I explain this?

"I see... my condolences."

Wait I have red hair now...

But what if she recognizes me despite that?

"No, it's alright, It's just a fact of life for us elves."

Will Phanna be able to explain?

Probably not on that last one.

"I-I see... So what brings you hear today?"

What's more risky, to stand my ground and pretend I don't know her or to try to avoid contact in the first place.

"I'm just here to thank you for protecting us during the exam. Here's some tea that we harvested from the mountains."

No I don't have time to think this through, I need to act fast

"Ah, I see, thanks."

I quickly hid my face behind my face behind my now red hair and assumed a position of what probably looked like meditation. 

"By... by the way... Master Mikay, could I ask you for a small favor?"

I am nothing, I am one with this table, please don't notice my presence. 

"Favor?"

"That's right, it seems the Mastery League's School in Mountainpass has suspended opperation this semester due to the attack and since the exams were interupted part way though, it doesn't look like anyone will be admitted this semester. Would you be able to find it in your hear to teach some of use who you find worthy personally?"

"Um..."

"Could you at least consider it Master Mikay?"

"I... Uhh... I guess I'll give it some consideration."

"Thank you very much Master Mikay! Oh by the way, how is Phanna doing? I don't see him around at all..."

"Phanna... is notcturnal... so they're kind of sleeping right now."

"Gasp... The exam must have been extrememly hard for him then..."

"Tell me about it... anyways, Phanna's been sleeping all day. I honestly have no idea what they're doing but I think they're doing alright."

"Ah, I see. That's good to know! Well, I see you have a guest over, I'll be on my way now. I'll see you soon!"

"Take care!"

As soon as Mikay closed the door, I let out a huge sigh of relief.

I was so scared I'd been found out but it turns out Amanda didn't recognize me.

what a relief.

"You ok there?" Mikay asked as he returned to his seat opposit to me.

"I... Uhh... was really scared. But I'm alright now."

"Oh, I was a bit nervious too. But things seemed to have worked out alright."

"Maybe you'd consider further changes to your appearance now?" Phanna said from behind me.

"Aahh" I shouted in fright turning around to face him.

"Don't be like that" Phanna protested.

"It's unusual to see you up at this hour" Mikay said.

"Oh, I happened to be using the washroom when Amanda dropped by. Whanted to see how things turned out. I was ready to intervien should that have been nesesarry."

"T-thanks I guess..." Mikay sighed.

"Um... Phanna, What happened to your hair?" I asked noticing that Phanna's normally black hair had changed into a deep shade of red.

"Well, I was going to tell Amanda there that you were my sister so I changed my hair color to somewhat match yours as best as I could in the bit of time I had."

"What?" Mikay and I both exclaimed in confusion and surprise.

"ya, I was about to introduce you as Midi but I guess it's a good thing I didn't have to. I'm clearly not good at this whole name business... except for my favorite slimes" Phanna joked while holding one of the two Pillows hostage.

"Uh... What about the hair color chang?" I asked.

"Hmm? what about it?"

"How?"

"Uhhh... hmmm... how do I explain structural color" Phanna murmured to himself as he seemed to be having trouble with coming up with an answer.

Mikay didn't seem too bothered however and just moved on.

"Well I guess it's good that the two of you are here, so what do you all think of Amanda's request?"

"I think it's great! You'll need something to do while I set up my experiments anyways so I think it's a good thing for both of us."

"You know, for someone who's 'busy setting up an experiment' I haven't seen you actually do anything yet... anyways, what about you Melody?" Mikay sighed.

"I... I don't think it's a good idea... I feel like it might end up exposing me..." I said feeling unsure.

"Now now, don't say that, you can't hole up in Mikay's house forever. All you need is a few small changes to your physical features and you should be all good to go." Phanna refuted.

"Phanna, I'm sure you can do all sorts of modifications but are you sure Melody is comfortable receiving those modifications?" Mikay asked.

"Why not? and besides, you building a relationship with these elves creates a pretty convenient way for Melody to see how her home turned out after her departure from the perspective of an outsider."

At Phanna's words, Mikay and I both fell into silence.

As much as I'd like to deny it, I'm very curious about how my colony, more spicifically, my party is doing.

How much better off are they without me.

How much more efficent they must be without me messing everything up every time.

Although it hurts me to think about all this, in a way I was very curious how well things would turn out without me.

But do I want to find out?

I was nothing but a hinderance before so I'm sure things are much better without me.

But I want to know exactly how much better things are.

I want to know exactly how much of a bother I was.

I want to know exactly what I was or wasn't worth...

I'm scared to know.

Knowing would hurt.

In a way, not knowing is a type of blessing but I want to know.

In a way, I could say that my soul yearns to know.

But do I have the courage to find out, to face the truth?

I didn't have answers to these questions.

I didn't know if I could get answers to these questions.

For now, it seemes like the only way for me to know is to be faced with the choice and to see weather I would run away or face the truth head on.

I wonder what choice I'd make once I was faced with the choice.

"P-phanna... c-can you modify my appearance some more?" 

If I didn't know how I would react till the oppertunity to find out arses then the only way forward is to bring about a future were the oppertunity to find out does happen.

If I am unable to face the truth then I'll just have to run away.

But if by some chance, I did end up finding the courage in myself to face the the truth, then I want to be ready for it. 

"Melody, are you sure?" Mikay asked heistantly.

"Yes, I'm sure." I replied.

"That's the spirit!" Phanna smiled patting me on my back. 

"Welp, as far as further adjustments goes, I'm going to need Mikay's help. I'll need to prepair something. Mikay can you get a few blocks of wood a bit bigger than Melody's head for me? oh and also a knife too."

"Uhh What? Sure? I guess?" Mikay answered hesitantly.

Phanna's request seemed to have caught mikay by surprise but he soon regained his composure.

"Anyways, I take it that you're both is in support of me doing some private tutoring for the elves?" Mikay asked.

"Yup" Phanna affermed while I gave a small nod.

At our answers, Mikay seemed to have fallen into some deep thought.

"Well. I guess I'll give it some more thought. I'll get you those blocks of wood then. How many blocks do you need?"

"Uhh... maybe 20? it really depends on you actually so lets start with 20"

"What?" Mikay said a bit puzzled but he didn't seem to press the issue further and left to get the wood Phanna requested.

As for Phanna, he began studying my face and head with extreme detail.

It made me rather uncomfortable in the beginning but after a couple minutes of it, I got rather used to it.

Mikay and Phanna spent the rest of the day together doing something to a block of wood.

I tried to ask them what they were doing.

Mikay ansewered with "I have no clue, ask Phanna." and Phanna answered with "creating art."

At the end, I was left just as clueless as mikay and ended up spending the rest of the day with Pillow and Cushen. 

The two blobs still didn't seem to like me much and would jump around when I approached.

I wish they would go back to being docile but the current aggresively confrontational blobs had it's own strange charm to them.
