# Reincounter

"Ugh... You're doing it wrong. You need to focus on feeling everything inside your Sphere of Influence instead of focus on the feeling of one thing inside of it." Mikay instructed.

"S-sorry" I moped

Training has been more or less fruitless ever since we started practicing together.

No matter what I tried and no matter what Mikay said, nothing seemed to help with improving my mastery over Influence Manipulation.

It's not like I didn't understand the basics, I did.

But for some reason, I couldn't perform them accurately.

I didn't know why and neither did Mikay.

This was the third time we were going over the basics because Mikay was convinced I didn't understand them.

I wonder if Phanna will be able to learn Influence Manipulation easily.

Probably will... I thought to myself.

"Try again, feel for what's behind you... good now feel for what's under the table... now don't stop feeling the thing behind you... good... now try to focus on what's to your left... No no no not like that!"

Yup, I screwed up again...

Just as I was about to give up, a knock came from the door.

"Huh?" Mikay murmured in surprise before going to check on who it was.

As for me, I remained in my steat and waited for the visitor to go away in time as I tried to relax a bit from the practice.

"Ah, Master Mikay, I hope I'm not bothering you right now." said the person just beyond the front door.

Just hearing this person's voice sent chills down my spine as I froze in terror unsure what I should do.

After all, to her, I should be dead by now...

"Oh, it's quite alright. I'm not doing anything too much right now. What brings you here miss... um"

"Amanda."

That's right, the girl that's currently speaking with Mikay right now was my sister, Amanda. 

various thoughts flooded my mind as Mikay and amanda made their excange.

should I run?

"Ahh right. How have things been for you lately?"

Should I try to hide in my room?

But that'd draw too much suspicion.

"Things... has been alright. I've been meaning to come by earlier but things has just been so hectic after Melody's passing"

But what if she notices me?

How do I explain this?

"I see... my condolences."

Wait I have red hair now...

But what if she recognizes me despite that?

"No, it's alright, It's just a fact of life for us elves."

Will Phanna be able to explain?

Probably not on that last one.

"I-I see... So what brings you hear today?"

What's more risky, to stand my ground and pretend I don't know her or to try to avoid contact in the first place.

"I'm just here to thank you for protecting us during the exam. Here's some tea that we harvested from the mountains."

No I don't have time to think this through, I need to act fast

"Ah, I see, thanks."

I quickly hid my face behind my face behind my now red hair and assumed a position of what probably looked like meditation. 

"By... by the way... Master Mikay, could I ask you for a small favor?"

I am nothing, I am one with this table, please don't notice my presence. 

"Favor?"

"That's right, it seems the Mastery League's School in Mountainpass has suspended opperation this semester due to the attack and since the exams were interupted part way though, it doesn't look like anyone will be admitted this semester. Would you be able to find it in your hear to teach some of use who you find worthy personally?"

"Um..."

"Could you at least consider it Master Mikay?"

"I... Uhh... I guess I'll give it some consideration."

"Thank you very much Master Mikay! Oh by the way, how is Phanna doing? I don't see him around at all..."

"Phanna... is notcturnal... so they're kind of sleeping right now."

"Gasp... The exam must have been extrememly hard for him then..."

"Tell me about it... anyways, Phanna's been sleeping all day. I honestly have no idea what they're doing but I think they're doing alright."

"Ah, I see. That's good to know! Well, I see you have a guest over, I'll be on my way now. I'll see you soon!"

"Take care!"

As soon as Mikay closed the door, I let out a huge sigh of relief.

I was so scared I'd been found out but it turns out Amanda didn't recognize me.

what a relief.

"You ok there?" Mikay asked as he returned to his seat opposit to me.

"I... Uhh... was really scared. But I'm alright now."

"Oh, I was a bit nervious too. But things seemed to have worked out alright."

"Maybe you'd consider further changes to your appearance now?" Phanna said from behind me.

"Aahh" I shouted in fright turning around to face him.

"Don't be like that" Phanna protested.

"It's unusual to see you up at this hour" Mikay said.

"Oh, I happened to be using the washroom when Amanda dropped by. Whanted to see how things turned out. I was ready to intervien should that have been nesesarry."

"T-thanks I guess..." Mikay sighed.

"Um... Phanna, What happened to your hair?" I asked noticing that Phanna's normally black hair had changed into a deep shade of red.

"Well, I was going to tell Amanda there that you were my sister so I changed my hair color to somewhat match yours as best as I could in the bit of time I had."

"What?" Mikay and I both exclaimed in confusion and surprise.

"ya, I was about to introduce you as Midi but I guess it's a good thing I didn't have to. I'm clearly not good at this whole name business... except for my favorite slimes" Phanna joked while holding one of the two Pillows hostage.

"Uh... What about the hair color chang?" I asked.

"Hmm? what about it?"

"How?"

"Uhhh... hmmm... how do I explain structural color" Phanna murmured to himself as he seemed to be having trouble with coming up with an answer.

Mikay didn't seem too bothered however and just moved on.

"Well I guess it's good that the two of you are here, so what do you all think of Amanda's request?"

"I think it's great! You'll need something to do while I set up my experiments anyways so I think it's a good thing for both of us."

"You know, for someone who's 'busy setting up an experiment' I haven't seen you actually do anything yet... anyways, what about you Melody?" Mikay sighed.

"I... I don't think it's a good idea... I feel like it might end up exposing me..." I said feeling unsure.

"Now now, don't say that, you can't hole up in Mikay's house forever. All you need is a few small changes to your physical features and you should be all good to go." Phanna refuted.

"Phanna, I'm sure you can do all sorts of modifications but are you sure Melody is comfortable receiving those modifications?" Mikay asked.

"Why not? and besides, you building a relationship with these elves creates a pretty convenient way for Melody to see how her home turned out after her departure from the perspective of an outsider."

At Phanna's words, Mikay and I both fell into silence.

As much as I'd like to deny it, I'm very curious about how my colony, more spicifically, my party is doing.

How much better off are they without me.

How much more efficent they must be without me messing everything up every time.

Although it hurts me to think about all this, in a way I was very curious how well things would turn out without me.

But do I want to find out?

I was nothing but a hinderance before so I'm sure things are much better without me.

But I want to know exactly how much better things are.

I want to know exactly how much of a bother I was.

I want to know exactly what I was or wasn't worth...

I'm scared to know.

Knowing would hurt.

In a way, not knowing is a type of blessing but I want to know.

In a way, I could say that my soul yearns to know.

But do I have the courage to find out, to face the truth?

I didn't have answers to these questions.

I didn't know if I could get answers to these questions.

For now, it seemes like the only way for me to know is to be faced with the choice and to see weather I would run away or face the truth head on.

I wonder what choice I'd make once I was faced with the choice.

"P-phanna... c-can you modify my appearance some more?" 

If I didn't know how I would react till the oppertunity to find out arses then the only way forward is to bring about a future were the oppertunity to find out does happen.

If I am unable to face the truth then I'll just have to run away.

But if by some chance, I did end up finding the courage in myself to face the the truth, then I want to be ready for it. 

"Melody, are you sure?" Mikay asked heistantly.

"Yes, I'm sure." I replied.

"That's the spirit!" Phanna smiled patting me on my back. 

"Welp, as far as further adjustments goes, I'm going to need Mikay's help. I'll need to prepair something. Mikay can you get a few blocks of wood a bit bigger than Melody's head for me? oh and also a knife too."

"Uhh What? Sure? I guess?" Mikay answered hesitantly.

Phanna's request seemed to have caught mikay by surprise but he soon regained his composure.

"Anyways, I take it that you're both is in support of me doing some private tutoring for the elves?" Mikay asked.

"Yup" Phanna affermed while I gave a small nod.

At our answers, Mikay seemed to have fallen into some deep thought.

"Well. I guess I'll give it some more thought. I'll get you those blocks of wood then. How many blocks do you need?"

"Uhh... maybe 20? it really depends on you actually so lets start with 20"

"What?" Mikay said a bit puzzled but he didn't seem to press the issue further and left to get the wood Phanna requested.

As for Phanna, he began studying my face and head with extreme detail.

It made me rather uncomfortable in the beginning but after a couple minutes of it, I got rather used to it.

Mikay and Phanna spent the rest of the day together doing something to a block of wood.

When I tried to ask them what they were doing, Mikay ansewered with "I have no idea, try asking Phanna." and Phanna answered with "creating art."

At the end, I was left just as clueless as Mikay and ended up spending the rest of the day with Pillow and Cushen. 

The two blobs still didn't seem to like me much and would jump around when I approached.

I wish they would go back to being docile but the aggresively confrontational blobs that they are now had it's own strange charm to them.

...

The next morning, when I left my room to have breakfast with Mikay, I was surprised to find Phanna sitting at the dining table instead of Mikay.

"Yo" Phanna gestured towards me.

"Um... good morning?"

"This was what Mikay and I were working on yesterday" Phanna said lifting up a somewhat disgusting looking wooden scupture that somewhat resembled a head.

"W-what is that" I uttered feeling a bit uncomfortable.

"A piece of art" Phanna replied.

I wasn't sure if Phanna was serious or not but that doesn't look the least bit beautiful to me in any way.

In fact, instead of beautiful, it made me feel all sorts of different kinds of uncomfortable just looking at it.

Phanna must have picked up on those feelings and began speaking again.

"This is a replica of your skull." 

"My what?" 

"Your skull, your head bone, the thing that gives your head it's shape."

I didn't know how to feel about it.

Seeing something that was a copy of a part of me made me feel uncomfortable in all sorts of different ways.

Especially if it was something that was supposed to be inside of me.

"S-so... what is that for...?" I asked.

"It's practice for Mikay. He's asleep right now but before he went to bed, I got him to make a few more of these." Phanna explained holding up a few more wooden sculptures of my skull.

I felt my stomach turn a bit as I laid eyes onto all the wooden skulls before Phanna.

"Anyways, Mikay asked me to make some food for you in the morning since he went to bed pretty late last night. What do you usually eat for breakfast?" Phanna asked as if completely unaware of how I felt.

"I... don't think I want anything to eat after seeing this..." I lemented.

"Perfect! I was hoping for that answer. I'll be off to bed now." Phanna hummed happily as he took off towards his room.

Wait he did that on purpose?

I was played?!

Somehow, realizing this made me slightly angry.

Even though I didn't know Phanna that well, this turn of events somehow made me feel a bit betrayed.

Feeling unhappy with the situation, I stormed into Phanna's room and nabbed one of the Pillows and stormed out.

Phanna, for his part, didn't seem too bothered and instead just offered some useless words.

"That one's Pillow. Cushen is the one in the aquarium. Enjoy your day~" 

I wonder how he's able to tell them apart...

But now's not the time to ask.

By the time Mikay finally woke up, I was feeling absolutely famished.

In fact, I was roasting some meat when I saw Mikay.

"Melody, you probably shouldn't be doing that... it's rather dangerous for someone your age you know." Mikay scolded.

"I... I'm sorry but I hadn't had anything for breakfast..."

"What? Why?"

"Phanna showed me the wooden blocks you two were working on yesterday and I ended up feeling too disgusted to eat anything after... Phanna used that as an excuse to not have to cook me anything and went to bed..."

"Geez... that Phanna... anyways, you go sit at the table, I'll finish this up." Mikay instructed.

At Mikay's demand, I left the fireplace and went over to the table.

"You did a good job starting the fire however" Mikay aplauded as I sat down.

"Eh? Well I sometimes end up on cooking duty for my party in the past so I know my way aroud a fireplace."

"Really? You elven younglings are much more experianced in life than I would have thought."

"Oh, uh thanks, I think. I'm just not used to other humanoids being not as tough."

"Well... life takes all kinds of shapes. I think the elves are extraordinary for how tough they are in general."

"Um... thanks Master Mikay."

Although this was indirect, I wasn't used to being prased so Mikay's words got me a little bit flustered.

Mikay gave me a rub on my head and went back to roasting the meat. 

The rest of our day went by in a pretty normal manner.

I practiced my abilities after what turned into lunch while Mikay created more wooden sculptures of my skull with the blocks of wood using Forgemaster.

After all the wooden blocks got turned into sculptures, Mikay left to do some hunting while I was left alone.

I took this chance to nab Pillow to play with again... or was it Cushen...

I have to ask Phanna to tell me how to tell them apart one of these days.

Mikay returned later with what looked like more hunted game and a few more blocks of wood.

Of course, I got scolded for nabbing one of the slime blobs to play with again.

Phanna woke up well after dinner time instead of the aftenoon like he normally does.

"I see you've made a few more of Melody's skulls" Phanna said after seeing the stack of wooden skull scuptures in the living room.

"I really didn't want to but considring it's to help melody, I feel like I have no choice but to go with your your strange plan." Mikay sighed.

"Glad to have you on board then" Phanna smiled.

I still didn't have any clue as to what they were doing but Phanna quickly asked me to leave the two of them alone for the rest of the night.

Of course, I took that chance to snag one of the slime blobs to play with.

Looking at them more carefully, I was starting to notice they did have some differences.

One of them was more aggressive around me than the other and when they're not busy being aggressively confrontational towards me, they'd often swim in different patterns.

I wonder if that's how Phanna has been able to tell them apart.

...

The next day came and went with nothing major happening again and I ended up sneaking in more play time with Pillow and Cushen. 

Of course, Mikay scolded me later but that to me was just a fact of life now.

After all, I can't resist the urge to hug something so comfortable despite them being rather confrontational at times.

However, just as I was about to head off to bed, Mikay and Phanna called me over to the bathroom.

"Are you ready for a complete makeover?" Phanna asked seemingly pretty excited. 

Mikay just sighed at Phanna's comment.

"Uh... um... sure? Would you be able to explain what you're going to do?" I answered hesitantly.

"Sure thing, Mikay here is going to use his Forgemaster or whatever you call it to reshape your skull. This will result in a bit of pain for you and your skull will take a few months to fully recover from the move but you should be completly unrecognizeable after the change." Phanna said sounding a bit excited

Then, Phanna pulled out 2 skulls and continued.

"You see, here, this, this is what your skull is like right now. And now look at this. This is what your skull will be after we're done. What do you think?" 

"Uhh... I... can't tell the difference..." I replied a bit unimpressed.

"Err... well... that doesn't matter, the results will speak for themselves. Anyways, your life is now in Mikay's hands. Take it away Forgemaster!"

I had no idea why Phanna was so excited about this for some reason but I had a feeling I probably shouldn't ask.

Mikay let out a sigh at Phanna's command and began the procedure.

"Permission for Influence Extention" Mikay asked.

Hesitantly, I agreed and once again, the strang feeling of losing control over a part of my body washed over me.

Then I felt my Sphere of Influence move.

It was an ability being activated.

The ability was something I was completely unfarmiliar with and it felt like my Sphere of Influence was being moved in all sorts of strange ways it wasn't ever meant to be moved in.

It was like a torrent of water, an unstoppable might pushing against my head that won't relent no matter what I did.

It was so powereful that my body decided that resisting was all but meaningless.

Yet for some reason, this powerful force somehow was bent and reshaped by some unknown power even greater than it and the force began to warp what felt like the very foundating of my being. 

I guess that description wasn't completely wrong since Phanna did explain that my skull was getting reshaped by Mikay's Forgemaster.

Yet this sensation was something beyond anything I could have expected.

The unstoppable torrent of power gripped me like a stone in the waves and I felt another thing began to move.

This time, it was something more Physical.

At first, I thought the force was pulling on my skin and muscles but soon enough, I realized that the feeling wasn't my skin and muscles being pulled but the bones that made up my skull.

Before long, I could feel a small, dull pain radiating from all over my head.

It wasn't anything worse than a pintch but it felt like it came from all over my face, as if something was firmly pressed into every part of my face.

"It's done" Mikay said cutting into my thoughts.

"Oohhh that's some really nice results" Phanna followed.

I quickly moved over to the water barrel to see my reflection and what I saw shocked me.

"W-who... is this..." I said completely baffled.

I quickly ran my hands along my face to double check the reflection and a slightly sharper sensation of pain echoed from the places I had touched

Yet that did not bother me one bit as right now, I was trying to confirm my appearance.

"I... I can't believe this..." I ghasped.

"How do you like your new look" Phanna said smugly.

"I... It's... unbelievable..." I said barely able to choke out those words.

It truly was.

My normally flat face was now much rounder and smoother.

My eyes somehow looked different from before yet I had no idea what changed,

My chin was now much sharper and my jaw looked like it almost melts into my neck.

These are only the minor changes I noticed, but I'm sure there's so many more I didn't notice.

Just what kind of black magic is this?

"Well. I'm heading off to bed. Terminate Influence Extention." Mikay declaired in an unimpressed tone and departed from the washoom.

But I couldn't even feel anything other than utter disbelief.

My appearance that I was so used to seeing had just been altered like it was nothing.

Even though I fully understood what happend, my mind was still unable to accept what just happened as I gazed at my reflection jaw wide open.

I wanted to ask 'How' yet I already knew exactly how.

But somehow, my mind failed to understand it and refused to believe in logic.

"Enjoying your new look?" Phanna asked playfully.

"T-this is... too much..." I answered barely able to string together a sensable answer.

"No, I think this is just enough. We couldn't modify your soft tissue but we needed to give you a completely different look. This is the least amount of change we could make to give you a completely new look."

"But I can't even recognize myself!"

"Isn't that the point?"

"It..." I stopped myself before I continued further.

Phanna's right, the goal from the beginning was to end up looking unrecognizeable and Phanna delivered exactly what he promised.

But even though that is true, it's still very uncomfortable to see myself looking completely different from what I'm used to.

I let out a big sigh and accepted my fate.

As if that was the cue or something, Phanna began speaking again. 

"Your face and parts of your jaw will sort of ache for a few days. The bones around the area that we modified will be slightly weaker for a few months so avoid being hit in the face. Also, you should try to rest more in the near future as it would help you heal faster. So, off to bed you go."

And before I knew it, I was tucked away in bed.
