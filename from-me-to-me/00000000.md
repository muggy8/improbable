# Prologue

Patrisha and her party were seated atop a tall tree overlooking the mountain and the valley below.

Normally her team was in charge of keeping a close watch of this chunk of the forest during the day and defend against any invaders or wiled beasts.

However, today was a bit special. Two of their own is taking a test to earn their enrollment in the School of Mastery.

This school isn't something that just anyone can attend.

Only the best of the best are able to make it... or so they say.

That's why the whole squad was overjoyed to find out that two of their own has made it to the final phase of the entrance exams.
