# Prologue

Patrisha and her party were seated atop a tall tree overlooking the mountain and the valley below.

Normally her and her team was in charge of keeping a close watch of this chunk of the forest during the day and defend against any invaders or wiled beasts and today was no different.

However, today was a bit special in different ways.

Two of their own is taking a test to earn their enrollment in the School of Mastery.

This school isn't something that just anyone can attend.

Only the best of the best are able to make it... or so they say.

That's why the whole squad was overjoyed to find out that two of their own has made it to the final phase of the entrance exams.

Of course, if not for the fact that the squad's absence would cause major issues with the colony, the whole squad would be watching the event in person now.

Yet even despite their unfortunate situation, they are very determined to at least witness some of the events themselves.

"Hey, Amanda's about to fight again! Everyone, quick, look!" yelled the girl looking through a round tube pointed towards the valley below.

At her call, numrous other elves jumped up onto the treetops and started observing the valley below with similar scopes of their own too.

Patrisha, too, pointed her scope towards the valley and started looking through it.

"Hey, that guy looks like a half elf." 

"Ya, he doesn't look too storng. should be an easy win for sis."

"Tell me abrut it, I remember him basically jumpin off of the platform at the start of his last round."

"Easy win, easy win!"

...

"Think he's trying to by time with the conversation?"

"Doesn't look like it, sis seemed like she started the conversation."

"Odd... Oh! they're starting."

...

"T-this guy..."

...

"Uh oh... What is sis doing!!!"

"No! No! your back!!!"

"!"

"!!"

"OH MY GOD!!!"

"T...that was too close for comfort..."

"Y-Yea..."

"I... I wonder which colony he's from. Those are some pretty flashy moves..."

"D...Do you think whatever his tribe is, they might end up being our enemies?"

"I... sure hope not... if even the boys are this skilled, think about how strong their women would be."

"..."

"..."

"I-I'll go report this to the higher ups."

"I-I'll go back to patroling."

"M-Me too."
