# Departure

By the time I woke up, the sun was already high in the sky.

I could hear Mikay and Phanna discussing something in the living room but I couldn't exactly make out what they were saying.

A light breeze rattled the wooden windows keeping the morning light from assaulting my eyes as I gazed emptily at the roof of my room.

Beside me was the rock that Phanna gave me yesterday with strange and unknown symbols engraved into it.

A memory of the dead in the culture of Phanna's home.

The symbols were beautiful and intricate, as if they weren't made by human hands.

I rolled over to look at this rock that was no bigger than a fist.

The symbols were round and curvy, where each stroke flowed into the next but each one of them were unique and easy to distinguish from each other.

I lost myself in the curves and bends of the strange symbols as I lay mindlessly on my bed.

I didn't want to move, I didn't want to get up, I didn't want to face whatever might happen today.

I just want to lay her.

I didn't have the energy, the will, or the courage to leave my bed.

I didn't even want to play with Pillow and Cushion. 

The only thing I wanted to do was to stay still, to be forgotten.

After all, I was dead already, so why bother?

A light breeze pushed against the wooden windows once again and a few rays of sunlight sneaked through the gaps of the rattling window.

But soon enough, the wind stopped and the windows calmed down and the sunlight was locked out of my room once more.

As the rattling noise of the window subsided, I started hearing other sounds more clearly.

Mikay and Phanna were still talking about something in the living room but I didn't pay it much attention.

There were occasionally animals that moved around close enough to my window that I could hear them.

If I focused, I could probably figure out what animals they were based on the sound of how they walked but I didn't have the energy to do that right now.

Before long, Phanna and Mikay stopped talking and the aroma of grilled meat filled my room.

I'm sure it's not just my room but all the rooms in the house.

I feel my stomach complaining but I still didn't move. 

I Just didn't feel like moving. 

I had no reason to move.

It's probably better if I didn't do anything.

So I didn't.

Before long, Phanna invaded my room holding Pillow and Cushion.

Noticing this, I turned myself to face the other way.

I didn't say anything and Phanna said nothing back to me either.

He just walked closer and closer and closer until he was standing next to my bed and then...

"Ahh! That's cold what are you doing!" I yelled as I felt a strange coldness wrapping itself around my body.

But before I could do anything, another part of my body was assaulted by an all consuming cold.

"What are you doing!" I yelled flipping myself over to face Phanna despite knowing the answer to my own question already.

Phanna somehow cooled down Pillow and Cushion and placed them on me. 

"Oh, you're full of energy today." he responded in his usual smug tone as he looked into my eyes.

"Here, I made a few more of these" Phanna said as he pulled out a collection of rocks from his pocket.

All of them had the same type of engraving on them as the rock he gave me yesterday.

The same type of round and curvy symbols, probably in the language of wherever it is he's from.

"What's this for" I asked looking at the rocks that Phanna was holding.

"It's a memorial plaque for all the people who's existence ended during incident at the entrance exams." Phanna answered.

"Wasn't I the only one who died?" I asked unsure of what to make of Phanna's answer.

"Yes, you died, well the you of this time line. But there were many others who's existence ended on that day as well."

"What do you mean?"

"I don't know who or why but someone took control over Mikay's body to re-write the memories of basically everyone after you died. And for those who's memories were altered, you can say that the existences of the people with unaltered memories ended when their memories were wiped."

I gave Phanna a look of confusion as he explained the stones. 

Noticing this, Phanna gave me a further explanation.

"Melody, what does it mean to be you? How are you different from other people"

"What kind of stupid question was that?" I asked a bit confused.

Phanna seemed to have expected this and continued

"What makes you different from the Melody that died in my memory?"

"That I'm alive?" I blurted out without thinking

"Then what if the melody of my past didn't die? How would you be different from her?"

I was stumped.

If this world had 2 of me, how would i be different from the other Melody?

Of course, I knew I'm different but I don't know exactly what it is that makes me different from her if we both existed.

I tried to think as hard as I could but nothing came to me.

If i can just be duplicated then what maakes me different from the other copies of me.

I would know but I dont know what the difference is other than the fact that I'm here and my copy is there.

Phanna noticed my silence and started giving me the answer.

"The thing that makes you different from any other Melody that might exist now, in the future, or in the past is your memories. If you have the memories of a person, you are that person. Well, it's not exactly as simple as that but the basic idea is this: Each person's existence is based on their memories. At least how I see the world. " Phanna explained.

This sounded weird and I wanted to object but I didn't have any arguements against what Phanna is saying. 

All i know is that memories being the definition of people is something that just doesn't feel right to me.

After all, I'm me and i'm not anyone else.. 

But according to Phanna, if had his memories, I would be him.

This just doesn't make sense to me.

Yet at the same time, there was something undeniable about what Phanna just said.

That;s why I didn't make any objections, I couldn't.

"And so, because the memories of the people who attended the exams that day were wiped and destroyed, I consider the existence of whoever it is they were up to the point of the memory alteration to have died along with the loss of memory. Whoever they are now are no longer the person they used to be. That's why I made these." Phanna concluded.

"What if, what if i have a bunch of dreams and in my dream, i get to see someone else's memories does that mean I become that person?"

"No. because you still have your own memories right?"

"..."
