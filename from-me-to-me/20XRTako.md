# Departure

By the time I woke up, the sun was already high in the sky.

I could hear Mikay and Phanna discussing something in the living room but I couldn't exactly make out what they were saying.

A light breeze rattled the wooden windows keeping the morning light from assaulting my eyes as I gazed emptily at the roof of my room.

Beside me was the rock that Phanna gave me yesterday with strange and unknown symbols engraved into it.

A memory of the dead in the culture of Phanna's home.

The symbols were beautiful and intricate, as if they weren't made by human hands.

I rolled over to look at this rock that was no bigger than a fist.

The symbols were round and curvy, where each stroke flowed into the next but each one of them were unique and easy to distinguish from each other.

I lost myself in the curves and bends of the strange symbols as I lay mindlessly on my bed.

I didn't want to move, I didn't want to get up, I didn't want to face whatever might happen today.

I just want to lay her.

I didn't have the energy, the will, or the courage to leave my bed.

I didn't even want to play with Pillow and Cushion. 

The only thing I wanted to do was to stay still, to be forgotten.

After all, I was dead already, so why bother?

A light breeze pushed against the wooden windows once again and a few rays of sunlight sneaked through the gaps of the rattling window.

But soon enough, the wind stopped and the windows calmed down and the sunlight was locked out of my room once more.

As the rattling noise of the window subsided, I started hearing other sounds more clearly.

Mikay and Phanna were still talking about something in the living room but I didn't pay it much attention.

There were occasionally animals that moved around close enough to my window that I could hear them.

If I focused, I could probably figure out what animals they were based on the sound of how they walked but I didn't have the energy to do that right now.

Before long, Phanna and Mikay stopped talking and the aroma of grilled meat filled my room.

I'm sure it's not just my room but all the rooms in the house.

I feel my stomach complaining but I still didn't move. 

I Just didn't feel like moving. 

I had no reason to move.

It's probably better if I didn't do anything.

So I didn't.

Before long, Phanna invaded my room holding Pillow and Cushion.

Noticing this, I turned myself to face the other way.

I didn't say anything and Phanna said nothing back to me either.

He just walked closer and closer and closer until he was standing next to my bed and then...

"Ahh! That's cold what are you doing!" I yelled as I felt a strange coldness wrapping itself around my body.

But before I could do anything, another part of my body was assaulted by an all consuming cold.

"What are you doing!" I yelled flipping myself over to face Phanna despite knowing the answer to my own question already.

Phanna somehow cooled down Pillow and Cushion and placed them on me. 

"Oh, you're full of energy today." he responded in his usual smug tone as he looked into my eyes.

"Here, I made a few more of these" Phanna said as he pulled out a collection of rocks from his pocket.

All of them had the same type of engraving on them as the rock he gave me yesterday.

The same type of round and curvy symbols, probably in the language of wherever it is he's from.

"What's this for" I asked looking at the rocks that Phanna was holding.

"It's a memorial plaque for all the people who's existence ended during incident at the entrance exams." Phanna answered.

"Wasn't I the only one who died?" I asked unsure of what to make of Phanna's answer.

"Yes, you died, well the you of this time line. But there were many others who's existence ended on that day as well."

"What do you mean?"

"I don't know who or why but someone took control over Mikay's body to re-write the memories of basically everyone after you died. And for those who's memories were altered, you can say that the existences of the people with unaltered memories ended when their memories were wiped."

I gave Phanna a look of confusion as he explained the stones. 

Noticing this, Phanna gave me a further explanation.

"Melody, what does it mean to be you?"
