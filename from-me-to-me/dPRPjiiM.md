# End of the Hunt

I sat anxiously watching Mikay, Phanna, and my sisters from afar hoping that mikay will be able to settle the situation.

I didn't know for how long I had been looking at the group as each second felt like an eternity.

Mikay and my sisters exchanged words many times yet the meaning of those words would not register for me.

All I could feel and understand were my own thoughts and my hope for a peaceful conclusion.

There were a couple times that it seemed like a fight would begin once again but somehow, it didn't.

After who knows how long, the tension that I felt finally relaxed as my sisters sat down one after another.

Seeing this, I let out a sigh of relief as I stayed by a tree behind Mikay.

As the tension left my body, I could feel strength leave my legs as well and before I knew it, I was sitting on the ground by the tree I was standing beside just a moment ago.

Thank goodness things seem to have calmed down now it seems.

Looking over to the group once again, it seems that everyone has seated themselves now, even Phanna and Mikay too.

Feeling a bit calmer now, I tried to focus on the words being exchanged once again but it seems I was a bit too far away to make out what they were saying but I was able to make out portions of what was being said.

Unsure of what to do I looked around to my fallen sisters.

Soon enough, they will all return to the earth however something pulled me towards them and before long, I was sitting besides one of the fallen elves.

Looking down at the fallen elf, I saw the familiar feature of a member of my family, blond hair, flat chin, silver eyes, slim lips, yet this was someone  I didn't recognize, someone who I have never met, someone who belonged to a different party.

"Ahh... reinforcements..." the fallen elf whispered looking blankly into my eyes.

Part of me was worried that I had been recognized but the deep red hair that filled the corner of my vision killed that thought just as fast as it had started.

I simply looked down at my fallen sister and shook my head.

"No, the fighting is already over." I answered lightly.

"Ah... I see... Thank goodness..." came a weak wisp.

And then, silence filled my ears.

The fallen elf didn't move and just rested there in the forest floor.

I looked into her eyes as she looked back into mine.

A feeling of emptiness filled me as I looked back at her silently.

I felt nothing, and saw nothing.

As if my mind was refusing to recognize the injuries this elf has sustained, I was unable to recognize anything other than her face.

Maybe if I did something now, I could save her but I didn't know what that something was, nor do I have the strength to take such actions.

So all I did was stare emptily into her lifeless eyes and before long, words started leaving my mouth.

"I'm sorry... I'm sorry... I'm sorry... I'm sorry..."

I spoke those words over and over again but the fallen elf didn't respond. 

Maybe she couldn't, maybe she no longer understands my words. 

But that didn't matter because those words were spoken for me. 

What happened to her was my fault, so I needed to apologize.

weather or not she can hear me didn't matter because this was something I needed to say for my own sake.

I looked up from the elf in front of me to find that there were bodies like hers all around.

To the unsuspecting onlooker, it probably just looks like a large group of elves taking a nap but the blood splatters all over the place and the stench of death that lingered in the air would make that an impossible conclusion upon closer inspection. 

The worst part of it all, was the fact that I was the cause of it.

If only there was something I could do.

Why am I always the one who's so worthless.

Why can I not do anything of value.

Why is it that everything I do is cursed to cause harm to others.

If only I never existed, then none of this would have happened, none of my family would have died.

"I'm sorry... I'm sorry... I'm sorry..." I repeated once again as tears flowed from my eyes once more.

I didn't expect anyone to answer, I didn't even know if anyone can hear them.

But that doesn't matter because those words were spoken for me.

Yet somehow, a response did come.

"Apology accepted."

The answer came from a voice I had gotten quite familiar with over the past few weeks.

I immediately turned around to find Phanna standing behind me with Mikay standing around a little further back.

"Lets head back for today..." Mikay said looking a bit sad.

"I... I see... Lets head back then" I meekly answered as Phanna patted my head trying to comfort me before pulling me up onto my feet.

...

The 3 of us walked in silence as we exited the elven territory that I once called home. 

As we walked through the various elven lands, memories of the time I spent here and there kept surfaced.

Many of them were sad memories but there were some happy ones as well.

I had a feeling that this will very likely be the last time I visit these mountains and even though my time spent here was not the best, I still have some strange feeling of attachment to these lands and my family that I grew up around.

Many of the trees here that may just look like any other ordinary tree was something different to me.

Although ordinary, these trees watched over me as I grew up, these lands provided for me through the good times and the bad times.

Yet as I walked with Phanna and Mikay, I realized that I will likely never be able to see these trees again.

"Can we... take a different path?" I asked as I stopped in my tracks.

"Sure" Phanna immediately answered while Mikay was being more hesitant of the suggestion.

Seeing this, Phanna immediately tried to convince Mikay.

"What's the harm in taking a few extra steps." Phanna joked but Mikay didn't seem to like the joke very much.

However, Mikay did end up agreeing to taking an alternate path and I was tasked with leading the way.

Before long, we were standing in front a small group of trees that seemed to be too small compared to the rest of the trees around. 

Unlike the other trees in the area, these trees didn't have leaves and had green spikes instead.

"Hmm..." Phanna hummed upon seeing these trees as if lost in thought of some kind.

Mikay, on the other hand, didn't seem to have noticed anything special about the trees but did end up realizing that we've arrived at the place that I wanted to visit.

"What's this place?" Phanna asked looking at the needle trees.

"This is the cemetery for the party of this area." I answered quietly. 

"I... I see" Mikay stated softly in surprise.

I stood before the cemetery in silence for a short while trying to sort out my feelings.

I didn't know what I wanted to find or what I was hoping to see.

I had visited this place a few times in my past but it wasn't a place I had a particular connection to.

If anything, the tree that I would sleep in during my past was probably the place I felt the strongest connection to, but visiting that place somehow didn't feel right; it would have felt like I was returning home.

But this isn't my return.

No.

There was no more home for me to return to in the mountain anymore.

That's why, the place I now stand before is the place of endings, a place of good byes.

I guess I might be here to say good bye to the way of life I had lived up to now, or maybe I'm here to lay rest to myself.

Whatever the case, something about this place felt right.

Finally having cleared my thoughts, I finally took the steps into the cemetery.

Phanna and Mikay followed shortly after as well.

I looked over at the trees as I walked by them.

Each of these trees had branches of other trees grafted into their trunks and branches.

"Let me guess, these grafted branches represent those who have died?" Phanna asked in his usual tone.

I gave Phanna a silent nod in response but Phanna didn't seem to even be looking in my direction. 

Instead, he seemed to be examining the various tree branches with names carved into them.

"So, what does this say?" Phanna asked looking at a branch with a rather exposed name carved into it.

"I'm not sure... reading isn't a common skill here. There's no way a nobody like me would know." I replied without even taking a look at the branch

"Is that so?" Phanna sighed as if lost in thought.

"Hmmm... You're right, there is a name carved into these branches. This one reads 'Molly' it seems." Mikay said with a bit of surprise.

"Oh? Interesting interesting..." Phanna murmured as he loses himself in thought as he began to examine the different branches with carvings on them.

Mikay also followed behind and started looking at the branches as well.

Instead of looking at the different branches with Mikay and Phanna, I headed to the center of the cemetery instead in search of something else.

The object I was searching for was a branch from a tree that could be grafted onto the spikey trees and the trees where those branches came from were located in the center of the cemetery.

Because of the situation with Phanna and Mikay earlier, there's not a single guard on patrol in this area.

Knowing this gave me a complicated feeling.

Sure, being able to do this the last time I am here despite the way I am now is an incredibly fortunate situation. 

Yet at the same time, I am the reason why this is the last time I will see my former home up close again.

Swallowing my feelings, I stopped before a small group of trees that had a slightly different colored needles that the other trees. 

To the untrained eyes, they might look like any of the other trees in the cemetery but what makes these trees special is the fact that during spring, they will produce flowers that glitter in various colors under the sunlight.

Of course, these trees were the source of the branches that were grafted into the other trees and I was here to find a branch for myself.

I wasn't anyone special, that's why, if I didn't do this, I doubt anyone else would graft a branch for me. 

In fact, I don't even want to graft my own branch; I didn't deserve it.

Yet even then, I didn't want to be forgotten by my home.

Even though I was nothing but trouble for everyone around me, somehow, even knowing this, I didn't want to be forgotten.

At the very least, I want this mountain to remember me even if none of my family does.

With that in mind, I started searching for a branch that felt right; something small, something insignificant. 

I didn't want to stand out, my only goal is to be remembered.

A small branch form the edge of the tree... but it has to be able to produce a flower in the spring.

"Hey Melody, there's a branch with your name on it." Phanna suddenly called out from near the edge of the cemetery surprising me.

My name? Is that even possible? Who would have done that? 

No no no, that's impossible, no one would have cared about me enough to graft a branch for me.

It's probably someone else named Melody from before my time, I thought to myself as I continued my search for a branch.

But Phanna called out once again throwing my mind into chaos.

"The branch with your name on it seems to be newly grafted."

Impossible...

That's impossible... 

There's no way that anyone would care about me enough to graft a branch for me.

Yet  my body, as if having a will of it's own, moved towards Phanna.

Driven by the curiosity that has gotten me into so much trouble time and time again, I ended up standing before the branch that had my name carved into it.

I didn't know how to read or write, but at the very least, I knew what my name looked like, and the branch I was looking at definitely had 'Melody' carved into it.

I immediately looked towards the area where the branch was grafted onto the tree and as Phanna said, the graft was new. 

The branch was grafted, at the very most, a week ago.

There was no doubt about it, this branch was for me.

There was no one else named Melody in my party and this cemetary was used exclusively by my party

Even if there was another Melody in my party, I was the only Melody that died recently and there's no way a branch could have been grafted for someone who had died today.

So who? Why? I was so worthless, I was so troublesome. so why?

Why would someone graft a branch for me?

Who would do something like this?

Is this some kind of a joke?

Something along the lines of 'remember that Melody person, don't be like her' right?

Why else would someone graft a branch for me?

I didn't know, I couldn't know.

Yet even despite thinking that, tears stared flowing from my eyes as I failed to understand what I'm seeing. 

"Phanna, did you graft this?" I asked despite knowing the answer already.

After all, Phanna can't read or write either.

As expected, Phanna answered by shaking his head.

I then looked over to Mikay but he shook his head too.

In tears, I stood gazed silently at the grafted branch unable to understand what I was seeing, unable to accept the reality before me.

Who would have done this?

Was this done as a joke?

Not everyone gets a branch grafted for them so why me?

This must be a joke of some kind right?

Why would anyone else do this for me?

Why... why... why... am I crying...

What is this feeling?

This pain in my chest, this discomfort in my stomach, this weakness all over my body. 

All of these feelings was normal to me, all this was something I expected of me.

I've felt them over and over again yet despite that, I felt like there's no reason for me to feel this way right now.

Everyone knew what I was, everyone knows who I was...

The failure that was me, the laughing stock of the party.

Me, who has brought so much misfortune to everyone around me.

Me, the source of all troubles to everyone around me.

Me, who couldn't even die without causing problems.

This person is the me that I see honored by the branch in front of me.

"Do you hate this person?" asked a familiar voice in a strangely unfamiliar way. 

I slowly turned my head to looked towards the source of the question, Phanna, who was pointing at the branch with my name written on it. 

As If responding to my gaze, Phanna spoke out once again.

"Do you  hate this person?" ask with a mix of compassion and pain.

"I... I don't know" I whispered in tears.

"Then what about this person?" Phanna continued but this time, their fingers pointed towards themself.

Seeing this gesture, my tears spilled out like a waterfall.

I tried to shake my head but I had no idea if i managed to do that.

I couldn't even see anything anymore.

But Phanna continued still.

"What about this person?" Phanna asked once more.

I couldn't see what Phanna did or who Phanna pointed towards but I felt a soft finger touching my nose.

Though my blurred vision, I followed the finger all the way back to Phanna who is now just a blur in my vision.

I tried to wipe away my tears and but more only came out to blur my vision once again.

This time, I didn't even make an attempt to answer Phanna's question.

After all, I couldn't give this answer no matter how many times anyone asked.

I knew the answer, yet I cant say it.

So I just continued to cry. 

Yet even despite my lack of an answer, Phanna continued as if I had answered clearly anyways.

"Would if make you feel better if I was the one who was honoring your death?" Phanna asked.

"I... don't know" I murmured once again as I tried to wipe my tears away once again.

"Then lets try it." Phanna replied.

Phanna then revealed a somewhat long looking rock that they had been holding on to with their other hand and wrapped it in a bit of the the shirt that they were wearing.

Phanna then gestured to Mikay and and Mikay came over and phanna dipped the rock into a bowl of water that Mikay had obtained without my notice.

My tears stopped as I was entranced by whatever Phanna was doing with the rock and the cloth.

As i looked on, the cloth that was wrapped around the rock desolved into the liquid and the rock started bubbling withing the murky water.

"Come feel this, it's quite warm" Phanna said to me.

Without thinking, I held out my hands towards the bowl of liquid and Phanna handed it to me just as quickly without letting go.

The bowl did indeed feel warm and somehow the warmth made me feel a bit better inside as well.

before long, the bubbling stopped and Phanna took the rock out of the murky water and showed it to me.

Some strange yet beautiful symbols I had never seen before were engraved onto the rock.

Phanna then partially burred the engraved rock into the ground vertically and then took a step back to stand next to me.

"Melody, may you find eternal peace. That's what it reads." Phanna said without looking away from the rock.

After a small moment of silence, Phanna then took the engraved stone from the ground and placed it into my hands.

"May you also find peace as well" Phanna said to me while looking into my eyes.
