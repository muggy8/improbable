# End of the Hunt

I sat anxiousely watching Mikay, Phanna, and my sisters from affar hoping that mikay will be able to settle the situation.

I didn't know for how long I had been looking at the group as each second felt like an eternity.

Mikay and my sisters exchanged words many times yet the meaning of those words would not register for me.

All I could feel and understand were my own thoughts and my hope for a peaceful conclusion.

There were a couple times that it seemed like a fight would begin once again but somehow, it didn't.

After who knows how long, the tension that I felt finally relaxed as my sisters sat down one after another.

Seeing this, I let out a sigh of relief as I stayed by a tree behind Mikay.
