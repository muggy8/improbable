# End of the Hunt

I sat anxiously watching Mikay, Phanna, and my sisters from afar hoping that mikay will be able to settle the situation.

I didn't know for how long I had been looking at the group as each second felt like an eternity.

Mikay and my sisters exchanged words many times yet the meaning of those words would not register for me.

All I could feel and understand were my own thoughts and my hope for a peaceful conclusion.

There were a couple times that it seemed like a fight would begin once again but somehow, it didn't.

After who knows how long, the tension that I felt finally relaxed as my sisters sat down one after another.

Seeing this, I let out a sigh of relief as I stayed by a tree behind Mikay.

As the tension left my body, I could feel strength leave my legs as well and before I knew it, I was sitting on the ground by the tree I was standing beside just a moment ago.

Thank goodness things seem to have clamed down now it seems.

Looking over to the group once again, it seems that everyone has seated themselves now, even Phanna and Mikay too.

Feeling a bit calmer now, I tried to focus on the words being exchanged once again but it seems I was a bit too far away to make out what they were saying but I was able to make out portions of what was being said.

Unsure of what to do I looked around to my fallen sisters.

Soon enough, they will all return to the earth however something pulled me towards them and before long, I was sitting besides one of the fallen elves.

Looking down at the fallen elf, I saw the familiar feature of a member of my family, blond hair, flat chin, silver eyes, slim lips, yet this was someone  I didn't recognize, someone who I have never met, someone who belonged to a different party.

"Ahh... reinforcements..." the fallen elf whispered looking blankly into my eyes.

Part of me was worried that I had been recognized but the deep red hair that filled the corner of my vision killed that thought just as fast as it had started.

I simply looked down at my fallen sister and shook my head.

"No, the fighting is already over." I answered lightly.

"Ah... I see... Thank goodness..." came a weak wisp.

And then, silence filled my ears.

The fallen elf didn't move and just rested there in the forest floor.

I looked into her eyes as she looked back into mine.

A feeling of emptiness filled me as I looked back at her silently.

I felt nothing, and saw nothing.

As if my mind was refusing to recognize the injuries this elf has sustained, I was unable to recognize anything other than her face.

Maybe if I did something now, I could save her but I didn't know what that something was, nor do I have the strength to take such actions.

So all I did was stare emptily into her lifeless eyes and before long, words started leaving my mouth.

"I'm sorry... I'm sorry... I'm sorry... I'm sorry..."

I spoke those words over and over again but the fallen elf didn't respond. 

Maybe she couldn't, maybe she no longer understands my words. 

But that didn't matter because those words were spoken for me. 

What happened to her was my fault, so I needed to apologize.

weather or not she can hear me didn't matter because this was something I needed to say for my own sake.

I looked up from the elf in front of me to find that there were bodies like hers all around.

To the unsuspecting onlooker, it probably just looks like a large group of elves taking a nap but the blood splatters all over the place and the stench of death that lingered in the air would make that an impossible conclusion upon closer inspection. 

The worst part of it all, was the fact that I was the cause of it.

If only there was something I could do.

Why am I always the one who's so worthless.

Why can I not do anything of value.

Why is it that everything I do is cursed to cause harm to others.

If only I never existed, then none of this would have happened, none of my family would have died.

"I'm sorry... I'm sorry... I'm sorry..." I repeated once again as tears flowed from my eyes once more.

I didn't expect anyone to answer, I didn't even know if anyone can hear them.

But that doesn't matter because those words were spoken for me.

Yet somehow, a response did come.
