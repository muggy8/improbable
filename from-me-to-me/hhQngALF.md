# Interlude: Phanna Observation Report

"Commander, we've spotted the strange half elf named Phanna again just now." called an elf look out.

Hearing this, Patrisha immediately climbed up a near by tree with devilish agility until she, too, had a clear view of the valley below.

Patrisha took out her scope and focused it towards her target and saw her target again.

That's him alright, she thought.

Ever since the day she witnessed the death of her sister Melody at the hands of this individual, Patrisha has been unable to shake him from her mind.

Melody wasn't someone special to the group, she wasn't even very good at anything in particular, but for Patrisha and the rest of the elves under her command, Melody was like family in a strange but comforting way.

Melody would often do many stupid things and couldn't control herself from causing trouble, yet even then, the group still valued her.

Melody had this way of breaking up the monotony of every day work with the troubles she'd cause and although tiresome to deal with, some times, it was better to tackle a bit of something new than to have to deal with the same problems every day.

That's why even though she caused more troubles than she helps, no one could really stay angry at her for long.

And it's not like anyone was ever hurt too badly in the process of fixing whatever problems Melody caused.

But now, the party had lost that spark of something new in their ever day. 

Each day went by just like the last.

Nothing unexpected ever happens anymore.

In the beginning, some of the other elves didn't mind it. 

After all, they didn't have to clean up after Melody anymore.

But as the days went on everyone started realizing the value of Melody. 

As they say: 'you won't realize how important something is until you lose it, and Melody was one of those things.

Patrisha was the first to realize this.

In fact, Patrisha realized this long before Melody partook in the entrance exams to the Mastery League's school.

Although Patrisha knew this, none of the others in the party did, including Melody herself.

That's why Patrisha suggested for Melody to give the entrance exams a try.

Regardless of how Melody did in the exams, she'd be able to better appreciate herself and hopefully, the others around her too.

At least that was what Patrisha wanted.

Yet fate had other plans.

And now, the only thing that could detract Patrisha from her feeling of regret is her yearning for vengeance.

Looking though the scope, Patrisha noticed another person had exited Mikay's settlement. 

This time, it was Mikay himself.

He seemed to be having some sort of talk with Phanna and eventually cut a slice off of Phanna's shirt and threw it into the pond on top of the building before retreating back into his home.

Phanna, too, retreated to Mikay's home after this.

"What do you think this could mean?" asked the elf lookout.

"I don't know... From what Amanda has reported, we can only guess at the relationship between Mikay and Phanna though it doesn't seem too far off of a master-student relationship so maybe it's some kind of training thing" Patrisha suggested.

"But the two of the barely leave the building. What kind of training could they be up to..."

"I don't know... but it seems like they're done for now. Keep watching them. I'm going to consult with mother on what we are allowed to do here."

"Understood!" 

Normally, each party is given the freedom to deal with situations as they see fit.

As long as the primary objective of the party is successfully execute to a satisfactory level, everything else is up to the party.

Patrisha's party's role is to act as a the primary defence against any invaders to the elven territory.

In the past, this would have been a difficult task before the colony had gained it's reputation and established it's footing

but now, the colony has already been fully established and has reputation for being a very formidable.

No one in their right mind would be foolish enough to attempt to attack this colony.

The only times Patrisha has ever seen real combat herself was when her colony ended up fighting over territory against other elves.

Even bandits and thieves would opt to stay away from the colony if they could help it.

Even despite all this freedom, Patrisha can't shake the possibility of ending up in a fight with another elven colony should she carelessly attack Phanna for the sake of her own revenge.

This is why Patrisha must consult with mother, the heart and soul of any elven colony.

Patrisha needed advice, no, she needed the backing of the entire colony should things turn out for the worst.

The only thing Patrisha can be sure of is that whatever colony Phanna's from, it must not be very developed.

Otherwise, there would definitely be more elves like him around.

That was the only thing Patrisha was sure of.

'Will I be able to earn mother's support?' Patrisha wondered as she made her way toward the heartlands of the colony to see mother.
