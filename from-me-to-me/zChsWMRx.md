# Professor Mikay

"Hello again Master Mikay. How are you doing today?" asked Amanda standing just outside of the door way again.

I instinctively tried to hide my face but I quickly remembered that I look nothing like the Melody she remembers anymore so I peaked out from under my hair to catch a glance at my sister.

Phanna's sitting next to me eating the strange food that he got from the rooftop as if without a care in the world but I knew that was an act.

Afterall, he is the one who killed me in this world and right in front of my sister Amanda too.

I'm sure the only reason he is thowing up such an act is because of the memory alteration that happened after the event.

Phanna was extremely upset about it for some reason when Mikay explained it to us but at that point, we couldn't do anything about it anymore so Phanna relented.

If that wasn't the case, I was pretty sure Phanna would have gotten into a fight with Mikay at that point judging by how aggrivated he appeared when he found out,

I honestly wanted to know why Phanna was so upset about memory alterations but it felt unwise to ask so I somehow managed to hold myself back from asking.

Looking at Amanda, she looked exactly like what I remembered.

The same blond hair, the same sharp face, the same golden eyes, the same pony tail.

It was as if nothing had changed and the way she spoke to Mikay sounded like she was not the least bothered by my death.

Despite me already expecting this already, seeing this first hand still hurted like being stabbed in the heart.

It was like being told I was a useless, worthless, and bother piece of garbage to my face over and over again but worse.

I felt like I could colapse into tears right then and there but I held it in.

But just doing that took everything I could.

"Here want to try some of this?" Phanna asked handing me a piece of the strange food he was eating.

The tone in his voice wasn't the usuaul playful or smug but instead it was full of compassion and empathy.

Was he trying to comfort me in his own way?

I looked at the strange black blob he was offering me and finally gave in and accepted his offer.

Peeling back the black skin on the meaty blob revealed the bright pink fish meat underneeth. 

"It's tuna" Phanna said as he peeled another one of these blobs and ate it.

"Um... thanks" I awakwardly replied as I ate the pink blob in the same way as Phanna.

This tuna thing was the softest fish I have ever experianced.

The meat felt like it melted in my mouth and the goo that the tuna melted somehow stuck together instead of falling apart and sloshing around like some sort of liquid.

The taste of this tuna thing was miled but pleasent and before I knew it, it slid down my throat and the whole sensation was over.

I felt a bit dissapoined that the whole thing was over already since it's taste exceeded all of my expectations.

Yet it was all over in just a flash.

Pannna must have noticed and offered me another one of these blobs saying "You must really enjoy these. It's written all over your face."

At Phanna's offer, I froze up.

Do I accept?

This stuff has to be black magic right?

There's no way for something this delicious to be able to exist otherwise.

But I already had some... 

I mean, if I already ate the poison then there's really no point in avoiding it even further right?

If I'm going to be cursed then I might as well enjoy it right...

No no no no what am I thinking?

I can't do that.

I only had one piece, that means I might still be able to be saved.

If I have any more, maybe I will be beyond saving.

"You feeling better?" Phanna asked disrupting my thoughts and retracting his offer of more of the strange tuna.

The sudden change in tone caught me off guard and left me confused and unsure of what he was asking about before I quickly realized he meant the situation with Amanda.

After realizing this, I gave Phanna a weak nod and he responded by rubbing my head a bit before eating the last of the tuna in his food tray.

"Remember, you're not the same Melody that Amanda remembers anymore. So don't feel bad because you're a different Melody now." Phanna comforted.

I couldn't even tell if Phanna was serious or not.

Just because I look different now doesn't mean I'm different on the inside too.

But there was something about what Phanna said that I was drawn towards.

Yet still... a different Melody? That was a bit too much right?
