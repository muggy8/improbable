# Professor Mikay

"Hello again Master Mikay. How are you doing today?" asked Amanda standing just outside of the door way again.

I instinctively tried to hide my face but I quickly remembered that I look nothing like the Melody she remembers anymore so I peaked out from under my hair to catch a glance at my sister.

Phanna's sitting next to me eating the strange food that he got from the rooftop as if without a care in the world but I knew that was an act.

Afterall, he is the one who killed me in this world and right in front of my sister Amanda too.

I'm sure the only reason he is thowing up such an act is because of the memory alteration that happened after the event.

Phanna was extremely upset about it for some reason when Mikay explained it to us but at that point, we couldn't do anything about it anymore so Phanna relented.

If that wasn't the case, I was pretty sure Phanna would have gotten into a fight with Mikay at that point judging by how aggrivated he appeared when he found out,

I honestly wanted to know why Phanna was so upset about memory alterations but it felt unwise to ask so I somehow managed to hold myself back from asking.

Looking at Amanda, she looked exactly like what I remembered.

The same blond hair, the same sharp face, the same golden eyes, the same pony tail.

It was as if nothing had changed and the way she spoke to Mikay sounded like she was not the least bothered by my death.

Despite me already expecting this already, seeing this first hand still hurted like being stabbed in the heart.

It was like being told I was a useless, worthless, and bother piece of garbage to my face over and over again but worse.

I felt like I could colapse into tears right then and there but I held it in.

But just doing that took everything I could.

"Here want to try some of this?" Phanna asked handing me a piece of the strange food he was eating.

The tone in his voice wasn't the usuaul playful or smug but instead it was full of compassion and empathy.

Was he trying to comfort me in his own way?

I looked at the strange black blob he was offering me and finally gave in and accepted his offer.

Peeling back the black skin on the meaty blob revealed the bright pink fish meat underneeth. 

"It's tuna" Phanna said as he peeled another one of these blobs and ate it.

"Um... thanks" I awakwardly replied as I ate the pink blob in the same way as Phanna.

This tuna thing was the softest fish I have ever experianced.

The meat felt like it melted in my mouth and the goo that the tuna melted somehow stuck together instead of falling apart and sloshing around like some sort of liquid.

The taste of this tuna thing was miled but pleasent and before I knew it, it slid down my throat and the whole sensation was over.

I felt a bit dissapoined that the whole thing was over already since it's taste exceeded all of my expectations.

Yet it was all over in just a flash.

Pannna must have noticed and offered me another one of these blobs saying "You must really enjoy these. It's written all over your face."

At Phanna's offer, I froze up.

Do I accept?

This stuff has to be black magic right?

There's no way for something this delicious to be able to exist otherwise.

But I already had some... 

I mean, if I already ate the poison then there's really no point in avoiding it even further right?

If I'm going to be cursed then I might as well enjoy it right...

No no no no what am I thinking?

I can't do that.

I only had one piece, that means I might still be able to be saved.

If I have any more, maybe I will be beyond saving.

"You feeling better?" Phanna asked disrupting my thoughts and retracting his offer of more of the strange tuna.

The sudden change in tone caught me off guard and left me confused and unsure of what he was asking about before I quickly realized he meant the situation with Amanda.

After realizing this, I gave Phanna a weak nod and he responded by rubbing my head a bit before eating the last of the tuna in his food tray.

"Remember, you're not the same Melody that Amanda remembers anymore. So don't feel bad because you're a different Melody now." Phanna comforted.

I couldn't even tell if Phanna was serious or not.

Just because I look different now doesn't mean I'm different on the inside too.

Yet there was something in what Phanna said that I was drawn towards.

But still... a different Melody? That was a bit too much right?

Having finished his food, Phanna picked up his food tray and left to dump what was left of it into the rooftop pond.

I wasn't exactly sure why Phanna did this but he calls it 'resource recycling' but I have no idea what that meant.

On the way out, he walked by Amanda and Mikay who were both still talking to each other.

"Thank you so much for accepting our request Master Mikay!"

"You're quite welcome haha."

"If I may ask, how do you intend to decide who you will and won't teach?"

"I've been giving that a bit of thought too. Some parts of what I will be teaching is general knowledge that anyone can learn but there are other parts that isn't suited for those without aptitude."

"That's unfortate..."

"I think to be fair, I'd be happy to teach everyone who attended the exam and if they can't keep up with the more difficult parts of the classwork, then it's up to them to decide how to proceed."

"E-everyone? I-isn't that a bit too much."
 
"I is a bit more than I'm used to but I feel like if I was going to do this, I should be fair to everyone who attended the exams."

"That's understandable but there isn't even a location you can hold such an event considering that Ethan's school is closed for investigations this semester!"

"That's true..."

"Actually... if you don't mind a bit of traveling, there is a place that could work for teaching and such within the elven territory."

"But isn't the elven territory heavily defended? I doubt other students would be able to travel to such a place safely."

"That's true. However, there's hardly any other place with a wide open field along with plenty of education related equipment avalable at the same place."

"Well... you do make a good point... But still, that would mean many of the other students who participated in the exam won't be able to participate. I'm starting to feel like maybe private lessons will be impractical..."

"Don't say that Master Mikay! You're one of the few people we could turn to in these tough times especially for those of us who's future are severly affected by the events on the day of the exam..."

"I... I understand but..."

"I don't like where this is going." Phanna softly murmured to me after putting away his food tray.

"What do you mean?" I what do you mean I asked back under my breath.

"This whole exchange between Amanda and Mikay is a textbook example of a setup for some kind of trap. Mikay is doing his best to avoid directly falling in but he's walking on thin ice now."

"Hun what?"

"I don't know what the elves are trying to do but they seem pretty keen on trying to lure Mikay into the middle of elven territory in some way or another."

"W-what? Why would they want to do that?"

"I already said I didn't know, remember? That said, it's probably to do with your death in this timeline."

"T-that's impossiable. You make it sound like they're out for revenge or something. There's no way they'd go thah far for someone like me."

"I wouldn't be so sure about that." Phanna insisted.

"Even if it is, what do they have to gain from doing that? Mikay is a Master. There's no way the elves would be able to beat Master Mikay in a head on fight without suffering a bunch of losses. Why would they do that?"

"Isn't that the point of a trap? To give the trap setter a big enough advantage that they can take down much stronger enemies"

"..."

"It looks like Mikay lost this time..." Phanna lamented,

"I... I guess I don't have much choice here but to conduct the private lessons in the elven proving grounds. However, I will be bringing a few other students along with me. That's alright with you correct?"

"That's not a problem. My party won't always be guarding the same area so be sure the other students with you will be able to to take care of themselves if it comes down to it though I do sincerely hope that that doesn't happen."

"I as well."

"My party is going to be on duty for this week so maybe we should use that time to get started? Maybe you'll get to meet some of the other parties and be able to avoid having any confrontations..."

"Is that so... I guess it can't be helped then. I'll have to start coming by tomorrow."

"I'll be eagerly awaiting your arrival tomorrow! See you then!"

"Alright! see you then!"

And with that, Mikay closed the door and collapsed onto a chair beside us.

"You suck at negotiating" Phanna accused.

"Well excuse me! You think you could have done better there?"

"You didn't even get the motive behind why she was doing this out of her! Sure maybe the end result would had been the same if it had been me but at least I would have gotten at least a hint of why she was after you so you can be a bit more prepaired when you actually enter into their territory."

"... That... completely slipped my mind..."

"Why is my sisters targeting Mikay like this?!" I asked feeling quite confused.

"I don't know. And the only person who had a chance of finding out completely screwed it up." Phanna lamented.

"I'm sorry... I was too focused on trying to get out of the setup..." Mikay blurted apologetically.

"Welp, what's done is done. Just try not to die tomorrow alright?" Phanna sighed.

Mikay only managed to respond with a dissapointed look.

This must be rather serious...

"M-maybe we should accompany you tomorrow?" I asked in concern.

"I don't think either of us accompanying Mikay would accomplish anything. Think of it from their perspective for a moment. They know from the conversation today that Mikay here already knows something is up and will likely be very cautious tomorrow and for the next while too. A trap generally doesn't work if the target is aware of it so unless either they've got something as powerful as Mikay here and a home terf advantage is all that's needed to take him down or Mikay here isn't as big a deal as you all seem to think he is, then, there's almost no chance that anything would happen tomorrow. That is... unless you know something that we don't."

It was pretty obvisous the final part of his statement was directed at me.

I've lived in the elven colony for the longest time and is the person who knows the colony the best.

A fight against someone like Mikay could easily push the colony to the brink of collapse. 

It's unlikely that the colony would lose but still, that would be too much of a risk for the queen to take on.

And all that is assuming Mikay is willing to fight a battle of attrition instead of retreating.

"Just try not to die tomorrow ok? I still need you to teach me this summoning thing," Phanna joked as I fell into silence.

Mikay's only response to Phanna's smug words were some grumbling.

As much as the two of them doesn't get along, Phanna seems to always have a way to get what he wants out of Mikay.

Mikay left for the elven village the next morning after cooking breakfast for me.

Until Phanna woke up in the afternoon, I was the only one awake in the room.

Now that Mikay's not here to stop me and Phanna's asleep, it's the perfect oppertunity to enjoy playing with Pillow and Cushen. 

I snuck into Mikay's room and found 2 mini aquariums on a desk each with a slime blob inside. 

Noticing my presence, both Pillow and Cushen started jumping within their aquarium as if they were trying to alert someone of something.

Unfortuantely, no one is going to be saving you two today.

But before I grabbed the two of them out of their boxes, I noticed something.

I've never really explored Mikay's room before!

looking around, the room seems awefully unremarkable.

It looks just like Phanna's room except the aquarium in the back was replaced with a large shelf that pretty much covered the entire back wall.

Otherwise, the room was rather empty except for the table and bed as everything else seemed to be on the shelf.

Most of the shelf was filled with cloathing and other things but a few of them felt particularly empty with only a few things in them.

Looking at them, I got the feeling that whatever was in those empty spots, it must have been very important.

Unable to hold myself back, I made my way over to one of these slightly empty spots on the shelf and found a small stone tablet that had engraved into it a portrait of 4 people.

The work was very detailed and must have been done by an expert artist.

Running my fingers along the engraving, I could feel the smoothness of the surface.

I wonder what it took to create something that felt this good in the hand.

Of the 4 people in the engraving, I couldn't recognize any of them.

They were all onis like Mikay, I could tell by the horns they all had.

3 of them were female and only one was male.

The male oni kind of resembled Mikay in a way. Maybe a brother? or maybe a younger Mikay?

I didn't know.

I placed the stone carving back and made my way over to another spot on the shelf that was slightly empty.

Here, I found a book, not just any book or scroll, but a very well crafted book. 

The coverings were made of wood with the titles carved into it but the pages between the covers where made of silk. 

I knew that books of this design was normally made of animal hide but to use silk instead... this must have been an extremely important book.

Unfortuantely, I had no idea how to read and flipping through, the book contianed nothing but written words so I gave up on trying to read it pretty quick and went to check out anther partially empty spot on the shelf.

Here, I found 2 things. Something that looked like a rectangular metal tablet and a pair of rings made of something really shiny and reflective.

In fact, I could see my own reflection in the rings if I looked hard enough but other than that, these rings were pretty boring.

They didn't even have any special color and just looked like someone polished some black metal. 

Moving on to the last somewhat empty spot on the shelf, I found a fancy looking tool of some kind.

It was a stick made of the same black metal as the rings earlier but the tip was somewhat sharp.

It didn't look like anything special had it not been for the stand it was found in. 

Looking at it, I couldn't really figure out what it was used for but it clearly was something special. 

If anything, it was made of the same stuff as those rings so this thing must have been important right?

Stepping back, I looked at the shelf again and couldn't help but want to dig through all the stuff on there to see what other oddities I would find but I knew that if I did, I'd definately get in trouble with Mikay later.

I'm sure I'd be scolded if I snagged Pillow and Cushen but digging through his belongings would likely get me scolded even more or worse... he might even throw me out...

Ya I probably shouldn't be digging through his stuff anymore than I already had.

Back to the original plan it is.

Snagging Pillow and Cushen's aquariums, I stealthily made my way back into my room and in hopes of spending the rest of the day playing with them

Unfortunately, that didn't end up happening as Phanna invaded my room and we ended up fighting over who gets to play with Pillow and Cushen.

Of course, we could each play with one of them but playing with both of them is much more fun.

Pillow and Cushen sometimes would climb on top of each other and other times, they'd race each other.

If you were cleaver, you could even chase them around and get them to run into each other and see their reactions.

They were truly very intresting creatures.

But having only one of them is much less fun than having both.

Phanna and I both felt that way and as a result, we ended up fighting over who gets to play with both of them for some time.

In the middle of our fight, a knock came from the front door causing us to stop our fighting for the moment.

Phanna, of course, acted before I did and went to answer while I was still unsure of what to do about an unexpected visitor.
