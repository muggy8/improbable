# Professor Mikay

"Hello again Master Mikay. How are you doing today?" asked Amanda standing just outside of the door way again.

I instinctively tried to hide my face but I quickly remembered that I look nothing like the Melody she remembers anymore so I peaked out from under my hair to catch a glance at my sister.

Phanna's sitting next to me eating the strange food that he got from the rooftop as if without a care in the world but I knew that was an act.

Afterall, he is the one who killed me in this world and right in front of my sister Amanda too.

I'm sure the only reason he is thowing up such an act is because of the memory alteration that happened after the event.

Phanna was extremely upset about it for some reason when Mikay explained it to us but at that point, we couldn't do anything about it anymore so Phanna relented.

If that wasn't the case, I was pretty sure Phanna would have gotten into a fight with Mikay at that point judging by how aggrivated he appeared when he found out,

I honestly wanted to know why Phanna was so upset about memory alterations but it felt unwise to ask so I somehow managed to hold myself back from asking.

Looking at Amanda, she looked exactly like what I remembered.

The same blond hair, the same sharp face, the same golden eyes, the same pony tail.

It was as if nothing had changed and the way she spoke to Mikay sounded like she was not the least bothered by my death.

Despite me already expecting this already, seeing this first hand still hurted like being stabbed in the heart.

It was like being told I was a useless, worthless, and bother piece of garbage to my face over and over again but worse.

I felt like I could colapse into tears right then and there but I held it in.

But just doing that took everything I could.

"Here want to try some of this?" Phanna asked handing me a piece of the strange food he was eating.

The tone in his voice wasn't the usuaul playful or smug but instead it was full of compassion and empathy.

Was he trying to comfort me in his own way?

I looked at the strange black blob he was offering me and finally gave in and accepted his offer.

Peeling back the black skin on the meaty blob revealed the bright pink fish meat underneeth. 

"It's tuna" Phanna said as he peeled another one of these blobs and ate it.

"Um... thanks" I awakwardly replied as I ate the pink blob in the same way as Phanna.

This tuna thing was the softest fish I have ever experianced.

The meat felt like it melted in my mouth and the goo that the tuna melted somehow stuck together instead of falling apart and sloshing around like some sort of liquid.

The taste of this tuna thing was miled but pleasent and before I knew it, it slid down my throat and the whole sensation was over.

I felt a bit dissapoined that the whole thing was over already since it's taste exceeded all of my expectations.

Yet it was all over in just a flash.

Pannna must have noticed and offered me another one of these blobs saying "You must really enjoy these. It's written all over your face."

At Phanna's offer, I froze up.

Do I accept?

This stuff has to be black magic right?

There's no way for something this delicious to be able to exist otherwise.

But I already had some... 

I mean, if I already ate the poison then there's really no point in avoiding it even further right?

If I'm going to be cursed then I might as well enjoy it right...

No no no no what am I thinking?

I can't do that.

I only had one piece, that means I might still be able to be saved.

If I have any more, maybe I will be beyond saving.

"You feeling better?" Phanna asked disrupting my thoughts and retracting his offer of more of the strange tuna.

The sudden change in tone caught me off guard and left me confused and unsure of what he was asking about before I quickly realized he meant the situation with Amanda.

After realizing this, I gave Phanna a weak nod and he responded by rubbing my head a bit before eating the last of the tuna in his food tray.

"Remember, you're not the same Melody that Amanda remembers anymore. So don't feel bad because you're a different Melody now." Phanna comforted.

I couldn't even tell if Phanna was serious or not.

Just because I look different now doesn't mean I'm different on the inside too.

Yet there was something in what Phanna said that I was drawn towards.

But still... a different Melody? That was a bit too much right?

Having finished his food, Phanna picked up his food tray and left to dump what was left of it into the rooftop pond.

I wasn't exactly sure why Phanna did this but he calls it 'resource recycling' but I have no idea what that meant.

On the way out, he walked by Amanda and Mikay who were both still talking to each other.

"Thank you so much for accepting our request Master Mikay!"

"You're quite welcome haha."

"If I may ask, how do you intend to decide who you will and won't teach?"

"I've been giving that a bit of thought too. Some parts of what I will be teaching is general knowledge that anyone can learn but there are other parts that isn't suited for those without aptitude."

"That's unfortate..."

"I think to be fair, I'd be happy to teach everyone who attended the exam and if they can't keep up with the more difficult parts of the classwork, then it's up to them to decide how to proceed."

"E-everyone? I-isn't that a bit too much."
 
"I is a bit more than I'm used to but I feel like if I was going to do this, I should be fair to everyone who attended the exams."

"That's understandable but there isn't even a location you can hold such an event considering that Ethan's school is closed for investigations this semester!"

"That's true..."

"Actually... if you don't mind a bit of traveling, there is a place that could work for teaching and such within the elven territory."

"But isn't the elven territory heavily defended? I doubt other students would be able to travel to such a place safely."

"That's true. However, there's hardly any other place with a wide open field along with plenty of education related equipment avalable at the same place."

"Well... you do make a good point... But still, that would mean many of the other students who participated in the exam won't be able to participate. I'm starting to feel like maybe private lessons will be impractical..."

"Don't say that Master Mikay! You're one of the few people we could turn to in these tough times especially for those of us who's future are severly affected by the events on the day of the exam..."

"I... I understand but..."

"I don't like where this is going." Phanna softly murmured to me after putting away his food tray.

"What do you mean?" I what do you mean I asked back under my breath.

"This whole exchange between Amanda and Mikay is a textbook example of a setup for some kind of trap. Mikay is doing his best to avoid directly falling in but he's walking on thin ice now."

"Hun what?"

"I don't know what the elves are trying to do but they seem pretty keen on trying to lure Mikay into the middle of elven territory in some way or another."

"W-what? Why would they want to do that?"

"I already said I didn't know, remember? That said, it's probably to do with your death in this timeline."

"T-that's impossiable. You make it sound like they're out for revenge or something. There's no way they'd go thah far for someone like me."

"I wouldn't be so sure about that." Phanna insisted.

"Even if it is, what do they have to gain from doing that? Mikay is a Master. There's no way the elves would be able to beat Master Mikay in a head on fight without suffering a bunch of losses. Why would they do that?"

"Isn't that the point of a trap? To give the trap setter a big enough advantage that they can take down much stronger enemies"

"..."

"It looks like Mikay lost this time..." Phanna lamented,

"I... I guess I don't have much choice here but to conduct the private lessons in the elven proving grounds. However, I will be bringing a few other students along with me. That's alright with you correct?"

"That's not a problem. My party won't always be guarding the same area so be sure the other students with you will be able to to take care of themselves if it comes down to it though I do sincerely hope that that doesn't happen."

"I as well."

"My party is going to be on duty for this week so maybe we should use that time to get started? Maybe you'll get to meet some of the other parties and be able to avoid having any confrontations..."

"Is that so... I guess it can't be helped then. I'll have to start coming by tomorrow."

"I'll be eagerly awaiting your arrival tomorrow! See you then!"

"Alright! see you then!"

And with that, Mikay closed the door and collapsed onto a chair beside us.

"You suck at negotiating" Phanna accused.

"Well excuse me! You think you could have done better there?"

"You didn't even get the motive behind why she was doing this out of her! Sure maybe the end result would had been the same if it had been me but at least I would have gotten at least a hint of why she was after you so you can be a bit more prepaired when you actually enter into their territory."

"... That... completely slipped my mind..."

"Why is my sisters targeting Mikay like this?!" I asked feeling quite confused.

"I don't know. And the only person who had a chance of finding out completely screwed it up." Phanna lamented.

"I'm sorry... I was too focused on trying to get out of the setup..." Mikay blurted apologetically.

"Welp, what's done is done. Just try not to die tomorrow alright?" Phanna sighed.

Mikay only managed to respond with a dissapointed look.

This must be rather serious...

"M-maybe we should accompany you tomorrow?" I asked in concern.
