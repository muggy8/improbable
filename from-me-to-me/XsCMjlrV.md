# Real Combat

Under the guise of going for a walk slowly as I made my way towards the region 11, where the help signal was saying to gather at.

Though I expected there to be someone to guide me away and back to the training grounds, no one did so I proceeded further towards region 11.

I had a feeling I'd find Phanna there for some reason as I slowly made my way over and unsurprisingly, Phanna was there but what shocked me was what else I found.

Before me, on the ground, was a horror the likes of which is nothing I've ever seen before.

Bodies littered the forest floor and many of them showed signs of fatal damage.

some had holes torn strait through their body while others where missing limbs or even worse, ther entire head.

Blood soaked the earth and as I looked up, I could feel my stomach turn trying it's best to eject whatever it contained.

Why?

Why?

Why?

Why?

That was the only thing on my mind as the contents of my stomach ejected through my mouth leaving the stench of stomach juices lingering in my nose as I fell on to my knees.

Why did I come here?

Why did this happen?

Why do they all continue?

Why?

Why?

Why?

I've been told before that as a front line solder, we should come to expect that we might die at any moment.

War over resources, battles to defend territory, hunting large animals to secure borders.

These were all dangerous tasks that those stations near the edge of our territory face every day.

Yet never once had I actually experianced any of those.

Dangerous wiled animals were uncommon and we've had no real troubls in terms of attacks from any of the villages.

We could push our territory as much as we want and yet, we encountered no resistance, no battles, no loss.

For some reason, I had come to expect the sort of lazy daily life as the norm but now unfolding before me...

Something inside me told me that this was what normal should look like, this was what living on the borders of our territory actually meant.

Yet even so, I was stunned my what I saw before me, the scent of blood, death and decay.

Somehow, I couldn't accept what I saw, yet it also somehow felt normal.

There was no fear in my heart, only discomfort and disgust.

As I sat there in shock of the nightmare before my eyes, I noticed something moving in the corner of my eyes.

Turning my eyes towards the source of the motion, I noticed Phanna being persued my a group of elves.

Not a single one of them showed any hesitation in their actions, not the elves, and not Phanna either.

Yet somehow, I was full of hesitation.

I could barely move myself as I watched the high speed persute in a daze as the world around me became a blur.

The motions of Phanna, the elves in persute, all of it melded together and became a blur.

But despite that, I could not take my eyes off them.

Something about this battle demanded my attention.

That's right, I came here out of curiosity.

I wanted to see the cause of signal for combat backup.

And what I got... only left me conflicted.

What I witness before my eyes was the work of a single person.

That person right now is being persued by a group of elves; no, two group of elves now.

Yet somehow, the person doesn't seem at all worried and carried on defensively like everything's fine countering every attack with something that I can only describe as elegant.

I was mesmurized by Phanna's movents but why? why do I feel this way?

I should be worried about my fallen sisters and yet, all I am doing is standing still, doing nothing, watching.

Is it because I know how powerless I am?

Is it because I'm sopposed to be dead?

Why?

As if on queue, a body shot out of the blur of a fight that surrounded Phanna and crashed into a tree.

"Ah!" I ghasped.

Looking at the body, I realized something; I recognized who it was.

She was from my party.

Even though all the elves in the colony are siblings and children of the queen, a party was something special, something more, a family within a family.

Even though I know the others around me are related to me by blood, I somehow didn't feel anything from them, but seeing someone from my own party in this state...

It was as if I was snapped out of my daze.

"Ah..." I sighed.

But who am I...

I'm nothing but useless luggage, what can I do? Nothing.

"Phanna..." I whimpered as my legs gave way under me.

"Why..."  was the only thing that came out of my mouth.

Before long, another body flew out of the blur of Phanna's battle this time missing a limb.

"Ah! No! Stop!" I shouted as an arm flew past me.

Though I did not expect anything, the fighting did somehow stop.

The elves chasing Phanna around looked towards my direction and so did Phanna.

For the first time, I could see Phanna clearly and the first thing I noticed was a blind fold on his face.

"Who are you! identify yourself!" shouted one of the elves who was pursuing Phanna.

"I-I'm Melody... I'm o-one of Master Mikay's students l-like Phanna... P-Please stop this..." I begged.

At my answer, the elf who shouted at me glanced at a near by elf and made a few gestures which I recognized as "Investigate her" before then returning to face down Phanna.

Phanna, during the short exchange, didn't say anything and just observed.

Before long, the elf tasked with investigating me was standing before me.

I didn't know what was going to happen to me but I didn't move at all.

Was it because I trusted this person as my own family or something else, I didn't know.

But as soon as I began looking into her eyes, I realized that I made a mistake.

I was picked up by the collar and slamed into a tree.

Pain and discomfort radiated from my chest and back as I caughed out whatever was in my throat.

"Are you Phanna's child" She asked while glaring at me with the intent to kill.

"N-No" I choked out as I thought to myself.

The elf holding me up glared at me up and down after my answer before asking another.

"Why are you here?"

"I was... taking a walk... and happened to pass by..."

"What's your relationship to Phanna?"

"M-Master Mikay... summoned... us both..." I choked out.

Ah, why am I even trying?

I might die here, and if I do, that's probably for the best.

My body would become one with the earth here and become food for the trees.

This will probably be my first, last, and only contribution to my home, my family, and my mother.

I glanced away from the elf who has me pinned against the tree in an attempt to singnal that I've accepted my fate.

But that fate never came.

I was dropped onto the ground as I let out an "Ah."

It was at this time that Phanna spoke.

"Are you all ready to negotiate again? It's pretty clear now that continueing this would be meaningless."

"What's there to negotiate? You've already done this much!" provoked one of the elves in anger.

"You know, I wasn't the first to attack. In fact, I never directly attacked at all. I've only counter attacked."

"Didn't attack? You must be kidding me right? Not only did you kill one of our own during the exam, you also decided to start setting up your colony knowing that we're near by. If that isn't a direct declration of war then I don't know what is!"

"Ah... about that..."

Before Phanna could speak further, the elves who were standing still just a moment ago leaped again to attack Phanna.

Phanna, of course, evaded and the persute began once more.

The elf that stood before me also darted back to once again engage Phanna.

But despite all this chaos, I was lost in thought by the short excange between Phanna and the elves, more spicifically, why is this happening.

The cause: me.

My death in this world lead to this whole mess.

All the bodies on the ground before me is the result of my actions.

I caused this whole mess.

If I didn't exist, Phanna and Mikay probably wouldn't have seperated.

If I didn't exist, Phanna probably wouldn't look like he's pregnent.

If I didn't exist, no one else here would be dead.

My existance killed all these people.

I killed them.

My sisters, my party, my family... all dead because of me...

Yet despite that, I am powerless to do anything about it.

I am truly a worthless existance that should have never existed.

"Ah... you! Aren't you one of the people who came with Mikay today?"

I turned my teary gaze towards the source of the question and found looking back at me a person I was very farmiliar with struggling to stand back up.

Medium short silvery blond hair stairing back at me with an air of confidence despite the terrible condition that she is currently in. 

This is none other than Patricia, the leader of my party.

As I was stunned to see her again, she spoke up once agian. 

"Sorry you had to see this. You should probably stick around with Mikay when you're here. If you don't, you might end up in the situation Phanna is in right now."

"Ah... I... um... I'm... I'm sorry..." I barely managed to choke those words out. 

Just seeing Patricia treat me as a stranger breaks my heart so much. 

She was the only person that had no memories of being scolded by. 

In a way, I idolized her. 

In a different way, I loved her.

Yet here she was, treating me like a stranger, yet despite that, I knew it was for the best that she doesn't recognize me.

Unknowingly, I found myself appligizing to her. 

Appoligizing for the mistakes I've made in the past. 

Appoligizing for the graveyard I've created.

Appoligizing for the lying to her.

Yet despite that, I couldn't say any of that to her face so the only thing i could say was was I found myself reating again as tears fell out of my eyes.

"I'm sorry... I'm sorry... I'm sorry..."

"Huh what? No need to get so worked up about it. You should go back to Master Mikay right now before what happenes to Phanna ends up happening to you."

"I'm sorry... I'm sorry..."

"Alright alright. Now get going. I still have some work left to do." Patricia said gently as she struggled to get herself back onto her feet again. 

Before I could say anything else, Patricia dashed off towards Phanna and joined the other elves in attacking phanna.

It took me a while to recognize this but as soon as I did, it somehow struck me what was happeneing. 

Patricia's life might come to an end today and the reason for that is because of me.

I didn't want that, I have to stop it. 

Even if she doesn't recognize me, I still owe her alot. 

I need to stop it.

But how... I'm powerless and worthless...

Is there anything I could do...

If only I was strong like Phanna or Mikay.... Mikay... Mikay...

That's right! Mikay!

I'm sure he'll be able to do something to stop this!

I'm sure if he explains the situation then the elves here will surely beleave him! After all, he's a Master and he was there at the Exams on that day!

I have to get to Mikay and get tell him to help!

Upon realizing this, I picked myself up from the ground and dashed towards the proving grounds where Mikay currently is as fast as my legs could carry me.

With a single activation of Quicken, I should be able to make it from here if I'm not stopped along the way. 

But I couldn't think that far ahead anymore, I just did what I thought I needed to do stopping at nothing as I ran towards my goal. 

Every second I lose is a second where Patricia is in further danger.

I have to hurry.

And so with such thoughts in my mind, I hurried towards the proving grounds where Mikay is currently teacing other elves.
