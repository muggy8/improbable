# Real Combat

Under the guise of going for a walk slowly as I made my way towards the region 11, where the help signal was saying to gather at.

Though I expected there to be someone to guide me away and back to the training grounds, no one did so I proceeded further towards region 11.

I had a feeling I'd find Phanna there for some reason as I slowly made my way over and unsurprisingly, Phanna was there but what shocked me was what else I found.

Before me, on the ground, was a horror the likes of which is nothing I've ever seen before.

Bodies littered the forest floor and many of them showed signs of fatal damage.

some had holes torn strait through their body while others where missing limbs or even worse, ther entire head.

Blood soaked the earth and as I looked up, I could feel my stomach turn trying it's best to eject whatever it contained.

Why?

Why?

Why?

Why?

That was the only thing on my mind as the contents of my stomach ejected through my mouth leaving the stench of stomach juices lingering in my nose as I fell on to my knees.

Why did I come here?

Why did this happen?

Why do they all continue?

Why?

Why?

Why?

I've been told before that as a front line solder, we should come to expect that we might die at any moment.

War over resources, battles to defend territory, hunting large animals to secure borders.

These were all dangerous tasks that those stations near the edge of our territory face every day.

Yet never once had I actually experianced any of those.

Dangerous wiled animals were uncommon and we've had no real troubls in terms of attacks from any of the villages.

We could push our territory as much as we want and yet, we encountered no resistance, no battles, no loss.

For some reason, I had come to expect the sort of lazy daily life as the norm but now unfolding before me...

Something inside me told me that this was what normal should look like, this was what living on the borders of our territory actually meant.

Yet even so, I was stunned my what I saw before me, the scent of blood, death and decay.

Somehow, I couldn't accept what I saw, yet it also somehow felt normal.

There was no fear in my heart, only discomfort and disgust.

As I sat there in shock of the atrocity before my eyes, I noticed something moving in the corner of my eyes.

Turning my eyes towards the source of the motion, I noticed Phanna being persued my a group of elves.

Not a single one of them showed any hesitation in their actions, not the elves, and not Phanna either.

Yet somehow, I was full of hesitation.

I could barely move myself as I watched the persute.
