# Phanna Encounter Report 1

"Hello there, do you have an appointment with me" Phanna asked jokingly.

Although Phanna seemed to be the only person around at first, it didn't take long for others to show up.

"You seem to be quite perceptive" Patricia joked back.

"You don't seem to be very good assassins. Revealing yourselves, even if your cover is blown, isn't really the best idea." Phanna scolded without event turning around to address the group

"You don't appear to be taking this very seriousely." Patricia glared back.

"Of course not, I want to settle this throug dialogue if at all possiable."

"You want to talk?"

"Of course. I have no idea what you're after but I have a feeling it's more so related to me than it is to Mikay."

"Do you really have no idea what we want?"

"I do have a couple guesses but I'm not 100% sure. That said, I'd advise against sudden and rash decisions as I want to avoid as much bloodshed as I can."

"Oh? Pretty full of yourself there despite being at a numbers disadvantage and being surrounded."

"Sigh... You're technically not wrong but your capabilities are less than intimidating considering all of you had a hard time keeping up with me even on your home turf."

"..."

Phanna waited for a responce but none came.

Patricia just stood there unsure of what to say next. 

"So, why are you after me?" Phanna asked after some time.

"Don't pretend you don't know! We know you killed Melody and we know you altered everyone's memories of the event after! What do you mean why we're after you?! And even after all that..."

Before Patricia could finishe her accusations, Phanna finally turned around and glared at her menecingly.

Even though it was just an angry look, Patricia was silenced, no, stunned.

'What is this feeling' Patricia thought.

This was the first time in her life where Patricia felt like her life was no longer in her own hands.

As the captian of her party, Patricia was natrually the most skilled and the most powerful member. 

She has lead the team through various situations but never once had she felt threatened in any way that could compair to the feeling of fear and oppression that Phanna exerted right now.

"Are you accusing me of committing memory genocide? On what basis are you making these accusations?" Phanna growled angrily at Patricia.

"I..."

"Yes it's true that I did end up killing Melody but the memory genocide is a completely different thing." 

For some reason, even Phanna's voice struck Patricia and the rest of the elves present as intimidating. 

No one dared to make a single move at Phanna.

"Well, at least you know the truth. That makes me feel a little bit better about what happened at least."

Somehow, even Phanna's calm words seemed to make the elves feel uncomfortable.

"So, what are you looking for? Revenge? Clarity? Closure?"

"H-how can you be so calm about this..." Patricia wheezed

But Phanna didn't reply.

'Did Phanna hear that? No matter' Patrica thought.

For Patricia has already recognized that this could very well be her final battle.

At first, Patricia just unsure of what to do but after hearing from Amanda, about the events of the exams, it' became clear to her that something must be done.

Yet as things unfolded, it became clear that Phanna had to be eleminated, not only to correct a wrong but also to protect the colony.

And now, she was ready to attack.

Patricia signaled to her team with her hands.

'I attack first. Engage after me quickly. Request backup when I engage.'

Now all Patricia had to do was wait for her command to be relayed to the rest of the party.

"I owe you no explanations" Patricia called out to Phanna finally.

Just this act alone was one of the most difficult things Patricia felt like she had ever done.

'Will I be able to attack? No, I have to take the lead. If I don't, no one else can' Patricia thought to herself.

"Is that so? Well if you're aiming to kill me the you should have done so quickly and in secret before my self defense system activated. Now that it's active, there's probably no chance for any of you to succeed I'll give you a bit of help however, here let me blindfold myself"

And without a second thought, Phanna tore off a piece of their shirt and tied it around their eyes.

"By the way, make sure to vaporize my spinal colum if you do manage to incapacitate me."

'Why would Phanna handicap herself' thought Patricia but she didn't let that bother her.

Patricia needed all the help she could get.

Afterall, Patricia knew that this would likely be her last battle. 

But even so, Patricia had a duty, a duty to her colony, her family, her future brothers and sisters.

In front of Patricia stood Phanna, the lone queen of potential another elven colony. 

'If Phanna was allowed to take root, her colony would inevitably end up in conflict with us' Patricia assessed.

That's why Patricia no longer had any choice in the matter anymore.

It's not just to correct a wrong anymore, it's for the survival of Patricia's famaliy, her legacy, her bloodline.

And for this goal, Patricia was ready to pay the ultimate price.

Fighting back her fears, Patricia activated Quicken and strengthen and immediately dashed towards Phanna.

A split second later, 3 of her subordinates jumped at Phanna too from different directions.

But despite the sudden attack, Phanna gracefully evadede not only Patricia but also the other elves too.

The next thing Patricia realized, was that she was now slamed against the ground. 

Thanks to Strengthen, Patricia didn't sustain much damage and she immediately got off the ground only to realize that she has no idea where Phanna is anymore.

For a spilt second, this fact brought panic to Patricia's heart but just as quickly, as that happened, she caught sight of Phanna again, dashing away from a group of elves.

Phanna, despite blindfolded, managed to not only escape the attacking elves grasps but continuously inflicting casualties.

Clearing her mind, Patricia once again joined the battle and once again, got absolutely nothing done.

It was as if Phanna had multiple instances of Quicken activated but just like what Amanda reported, nothing of the sort was detected by any of the attacking elves.

Patricia got up once again and this time, she didn't engage immediately, instead, she simply observed.

'Reinforcements were coming' Patricia thought. 'that means we will likely win if we draw this out.' She concluded.

But just as she thought this, blood splattered all over Patricia's body, not just hers but everybodys.

The source, Phanna's foot, more spicifically, beneeth it.

One of Patricia's party members, no, sisters, was just killed; her skull crushed beneath Phanna's bird like foot.

It was obvious what had happened.

The elf was no longer able to keep Strengthen active anymore and the damage she took from Phanna's attack was too much for her body to handle.

For a moment, time stood still.

This was something Patricia was prepaired for.

After all, on the boundaries of the colony, death follows everyone like flies to rotting meat.

One wrong step and everything could be over... or at least that was how things were supposed to be.

Patricia knew that but knowing something and experiancing it is two different things and for the first time, Patricia felt what it was truly like to be a boundy party.

In the very  next instant, Patricia found herself dashing towards Phanna again.

Was it anger that propeled her or something else; that didn't matter anymore to Patricia.

Sha had been watching Phanna for a bit now and she had a plan. 

Phanna always coonter attacks, all Patricia would have to do is faint an attack, wait for the counter attack then catch Phanna in an unfavorable situation during Phanna's counter attack.

But will Patricia be abls to performe this sequenoe of actions?

Shaking herself free of her thoughts, Patricia refocused and dashed again.

'I may not be able to fully keep track of your movements but you're still being way too predictable!' Patricia thought as she formulated her attack strategy.

Patricia might not know how Phanna deflected her attacks the first two times but she's seen it from afar now, she's made quite a few observations.

1. Phanna never stay still and will move around often.
2. Phanna always counter attacks
3. Phanna always evades first then counter attacks when the attacker's footing is unstable.
4. Phanna rarely jumps
5. When Phanna does jump, they will use the landing of the jump as a counter attack too.
6. Phanna never initiates any attacks.

Such brutal efficiency was something that both amazed and terrified Patricia as she charged in towards Phanna.

First came Patricia's faint, a quick jab towards Phanna's head.

Phanna made an attempt at perrying but Patricia immediately pull the jab back and threw another one out towards Phanna's torsal.

All the while, Patricia let her body get carried by momentum towards Phanna.

This forced Phanna to evade sideways to avoid Patricia but this too was all withing Patricia's predictions as she immediately changed her path to follow Phanna.

However, Phanna didn't seem the least bit Phased at all by this and immediately reacted by jumping back further.

Of course, Patricia gave chase; afterall, she had the advantage in numbers.

But that's when things changed again.

Phanna retreated towards a tree, grabbed a branch mid regtreat to change directions and upon letting go, the branch sprung back towards Patricia in close persute.

Patricia, in close persute, couldn't react in time and only barely managed to avoid receiving a direct hit from the branch but Phanna was on the move already.

In the split second that Patricia was destracted by the branch, Phanna had already reversed the situation and was circling around for a counter attack.

Before she realized what was happening, Patricia had received a lethal kick straight on her neck.

If not for strengthen, Patricia was sure she would have die from that.

'That's just not fair... this is our turf...' Patricia thought as she passed out.
