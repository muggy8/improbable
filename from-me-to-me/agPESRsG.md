# Phanna Encounter Report 1

Phanna moved through the forest like water in a river, unimpeded by any obstacle and at a constant speed.

To the followers, this movement was both mysterious yet mesmerizing. 

Not only were the trees branches being used as platforms, everything in the environment was being used as well.

The tall tree trunks were being used as vertical jumping off points by Phanna in ways the pursuers never would have even considered.

Jumps widely considered to be too dangerous or impossible for the average person was being attempted and cleared with ease by Phanna.

It felt like the only thing Phanna didn't do was touch the ground.

And that made sense, this area of the forest floor was full of vegetation.

Even Phanna would likely have a hard time traversing that concluded Phanna's pursuers.

Even though Phanna was their target, the pursuers couldn't help but be drawn in by Phanna's elegant, purposeful, and efficient movements and the incredible speeds at which these maneuvers were performed.

Somehow, even though this was Phanna's first time in this forest, they were flowing through the forest as if this was all planed out.

Every step felt deliberate, every swing felt purposeful.

Even at the speeds they were going, Phanna moved with a sense of ease and freedom.

Even though the pursuers were made up of some of the most skilled elves of the colony, chasing Phanna with what should have been home field advantage was still somehow incredibly difficult.

Phanna's pursuers were all barely able to keep pace following Phanna. 

Alas, the mad dash came to an end at the base of a cliff.

"Hello there, do you have an appointment with me" Phanna asked jokingly.

Although Phanna seemed to be the only person around at first, it didn't take long for others to show up.

- "You seem to be quite perceptive" Patrisha, the leader of the pursuers, joked back as she tried to catch her breath.

"You don't seem to be very good assassins. Revealing yourselves isn't really a good idea even if your cover is blown." Phanna scolded without event turning around to address the group

"You don't appear to be taking this very seriously." Patrisha glared back.

"Of course not, I want to settle this through dialogue if at all possible."

"You want to talk?"

"Of course. I have no idea what you're after but I have a feeling it's more so related to me than it is to Mikay."

"Do you really have no idea what we want?"

"I do have a couple guesses but I'm not 100% sure. That said, I'd advise against sudden and rash decisions as I want to avoid as much bloodshed as I can."

"Oh? Pretty full of yourself there despite being at a numbers disadvantage and being surrounded."

"Sigh... You're technically not wrong but considering all of you had a hard time keeping up with me even on your home turf, it really doesn't make me feel like I'd have to be too cautious of you lot."

"..."

Phanna waited for a response but none came.

Patrisha just stood there unsure of what to say next. 

"So, why are you after me?" Phanna asked after some time.

"Don't pretend you don't know! We know you killed Melody and we know you altered everyone's memories of the event after! What do you mean why we're after you?! And even after all that..."

Before Patrisha could finish her accusations, Phanna finally turned around and glared at her menacingly.

Even though it was just an angry look, Patrisha was silenced, no, stunned.

'What is this feeling' Patrisha thought.

This was the first time in her life where Patrisha felt like her life was no longer in her own hands.

As the captain of her party, Patrisha was naturally the most skilled and the most powerful member. 

She has lead the team through various situations but never once had she felt threatened in any way that could compare to the feeling of fear and oppression that Phanna exerted right now.

"Are you accusing me of committing mass memory murders? On what basis are you making these accusations?" Phanna growled angrily at Patrisha.

"I..."

"Yes it's true that I did end up killing Melody but the memory murders is a completely different thing." 

For some reason, even Phanna's voice struck Patrisha and the rest of the elves present as intimidating. 

No one dared to make a single move at Phanna.

"Well, at least you know the truth. That makes me feel a little bit better about what happened at least."

Somehow, even Phanna's calm words seemed to make the elves feel uncomfortable.

"So, what are you looking for? Revenge? Clarity? Closure?"

"H-how can you be so calm about this..." Patrisha wheezed

But Phanna didn't reply.

'Did Phanna hear that? No matter' Patrica thought.

For Patrisha has already recognized that this could very well be her final battle.

At first, Patrisha was just unsure of what to do but after hearing from Amanda, about the events of the exams, it' became clear to her that something must be done.

Yet as things unfolded, it became clear that Phanna had to be eliminated, not only to correct a wrong but also to protect the colony.

And now, she was ready to attack.

Patrisha signaled to her team with her hands.

'I attack first. Engage after me quickly. Request backup when I engage.'

Now all Patrisha had to do was wait for her command to be relayed to the rest of the party.

"I owe you no explanations" Patrisha called out to Phanna finally.

Just this act alone was one of the most difficult things Patrisha felt like she had ever done.

'Will I be able to attack? No, I have to take the lead. If I don't, no one else can' Patrisha thought to herself.

"Is that so? Well if you're aiming to kill me the you should have done so quickly and in secret before my self defense system activated. Now that it's active, there's probably no chance for any of you to succeed I'll give you a bit of help however, here let me blindfold myself"

And without a second thought, Phanna tore off a piece of their shirt and tied it around their eyes.

"By the way, make sure to vaporize my spinal column if you do manage to incapacitate me."

'Why would Phanna handicap herself' thought Patrisha but she didn't let that bother her.

Patrisha needed all the help she could get.

After all, Patrisha knew that this would likely be her last battle. 

But even so, Patrisha had a duty, a duty to her colony, her family, her future brothers and sisters.

In front of Patrisha stood Phanna, the lone queen of potentially another elven colony. 

'If Phanna was allowed to take root, her colony would inevitably end up in conflict with us' Patrisha assessed.

That's why Patrisha no longer had any choice in the matter anymore.

It's not just to correct a wrong anymore, it's for the survival of Patrisha's family, her legacy, her bloodline.

And for this goal, Patrisha was ready to pay the ultimate price.

Fighting back her fears, Patrisha activated Quicken and Strengthen and immediately dashed towards Phanna.

A split second later, 3 of her subordinates jumped at Phanna too from different directions.

But despite the sudden attack, Phanna gracefully evaded not only Patrisha but also the other elves too.

The next thing Patrisha realized, was that she was now slammed against the ground. 

How Phanna did this was beyond Patrisha's understanding.

Patrisha was sure she had her eyes locked on Phanna the whole time but she realized that she clearly didn't since she missed the counter attack.

However, thanks to Strengthen, Patrisha didn't sustain much damage and she immediately got off the ground only to realize that she has no idea where Phanna is anymore.

For a split second, this fact brought panic to Patrisha's heart but just as quickly, as that happened, she caught sight of Phanna again, dashing away from a group of elves.

Phanna, despite blindfolded, managed to not only escape the attacking elves grasps but continuously inflicting casualties.

Clearing her mind, Patrisha once again joined the battle and once again, got absolutely nothing done.

It was as if Phanna had multiple instances of Quicken activated but just like what Amanda reported, nothing of the sort was detected by any of the attacking elves.

Patrisha got up once again and this time, she didn't engage immediately, instead, she simply observed.

'Reinforcements were coming' Patrisha thought. 'that means we will likely win if we draw this out.' She concluded.

But just as she thought this, blood splattered all over Patrisha's body, not just hers but everybody.

The source, Phanna's foot, more specifically, beneath it.

One of Patrisha's party members, no, sisters, was just killed; her skull crushed beneath Phanna's bird like foot.

It was obvious what had happened.

The elf was no longer able to keep Strengthen active anymore and the damage she took from Phanna's attack was too much for her body to handle.

For a moment, time stood still.

This was something Patrisha was prepared for.

After all, on the boundaries of the colony, death follows everyone like flies to rotting meat.

One wrong step and everything could be over... or at least that was how things were supposed to be.

Patrisha knew that but knowing something and experiencing it is two different things and for the first time, Patrisha felt what it was truly like to be a boundary party.

In the very  next instant, Patrisha found herself dashing towards Phanna again.

Was it anger that propelled her or something else; that didn't matter anymore to Patrisha.

She had been watching Phanna for a bit now and she had a plan. 

Phanna always counter attacks, all Patrisha would have to do is faint an attack, wait for the counter attack then catch Phanna in an unfavorable situation during Phanna's counter attack.

But will Patrisha be able to perform this sequence of actions?

Shaking herself free of her thoughts, Patrisha refocused and dashed again.

'I may not be able to fully keep track of your movements but you're still being way too predictable!' Patrisha thought as she formulated her attack strategy.

Patrisha might not know how Phanna deflected her attacks the first two times but she's seen it from afar now, she's made quite a few observations.

1. Phanna never stay still and will move around often.
2. Phanna always counter attacks
3. Phanna always evades first then counter attacks when the attacker's footing is unstable.
4. Phanna rarely jumps
5. When Phanna does jump, they will use the landing of the jump as a counter attack too.
6. Phanna never initiates any attacks.

Such brutal efficiency was something that both amazed and terrified Patrisha as she charged in towards Phanna.

First came Patrisha's faint, a quick jab towards Phanna's head.

Phanna made an attempt at parrying which Patrisha finally caught sight of.

Using the knowledge from her observations, Patrisha immediately pull the jab back and threw another one out towards Phanna's tarsal.

All the while, Patrisha let her body get carried by momentum towards Phanna.

This forced Phanna to evade sideways to avoid Patrisha but this too was all withing Patrisha's predictions as she immediately changed her path to follow Phanna.

However, Phanna didn't seem the least bit Phased at all by this and immediately reacted by jumping back further.

Of course, Patrisha gave chase; after all, she had the advantage in numbers.

But that's when things changed again.

Phanna retreated towards a tree, grabbed a branch mid retreat to change directions and upon letting go, the branch sprung back towards Patrisha in close pursuit.

Patrisha, barely react in time and only barely managed to avoid receiving a direct hit from the branch but Phanna was on the move already.

In the split second that Patrisha was detracted by the branch, Phanna had already reversed the situation and was circling around for a counter attack.

Before she realized what was happening, Patrisha had received a lethal kick straight to her neck.

If not for strengthen, Patrisha was sure she would have die from that.

'That's just not fair... this is our turf...' Patrisha thought as she passed on impact with the ground.
