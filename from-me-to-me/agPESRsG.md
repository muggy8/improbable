# Phanna Encounter Report 1

"Hello there, do you have an appointment with me" Phanna asked jokingly.

Although Phanna seemed to be the only person around at first, it didn't take long for others to show up.

"You seem to be quite perceptive" Patricia joked back.

"You don't seem to be very good assassins. Revealing yourselves, even if your cover is blown, isn't really the best idea." Phanna scolded without event turning around to address the group

"You don't appear to be taking this very seriousely." Patricia glared back.

"Of course not, I want to settle this throug dialogue if at all possiable."

"You want to talk?"

"Of course. I have no idea what you're after but I have a feeling it's more so related to me than it is to Mikay."

"Do you really have no idea what we want?"

"I do have a couple guesses but I'm not 100% sure. That said, I'd advise against sudden and rash decisions as I want to avoid as much bloodshed as I can."

"Oh? Pretty full of yourself there despite being at a numbers disadvantage and being surrounded."

"Sigh... You're technically not wrong but your capabilities are less than intimidating considering all of you had a hard time keeping up with me even on your home turf."

"..."

Phanna waited for a responce but none came.

Patricia just stood there unsure of what to say next. 

"So, why are you after me?" Phanna asked after some time.

"Don't pretend you don't know! We know you killed Melody and we know you altered everyone's memories of the event after! What do you mean why we're after you?! And even after all that..."

Before Patricia could finishe her accusations, Phanna finally turned around and glared at her menecingly.

Even though it was just an angry look, Patricia was silenced, no, stunned.

'What is this feeling' Patricia thought.

This was the first time in her life where Patricia felt like her life was no longer in her own hands.

As the captian of her party, Patricia was natrually the most skilled and the most powerful member. 

She has lead the team through various situations but never once had she felt threatened in any way that could compair to the feeling of fear and oppression that Phanna exerted right now.

"Are you accusing me of committing memory genocide? On what basis are you making these accusations?" Phanna growled angrily at Patricia.

"I..."

"Yes it's true that I did end up killing Melody but the memory genocide is a completely different thing." 

For some reason, even Phanna's voice struck Patricia and the rest of the elves present as intimidating. 

No one dared to make a single move at Phanna.

"Well, at least you know the truth. That makes me feel a little bit better about what happened at least."

Somehow, even Phanna's calm words seemed to make the elves feel uncomfortable.

"So, what are you looking for? Revenge? Clarity? Closure?"

"H-how can you be so calm about this..." Patricia wheezed

But Phanna didn't reply.

'Did Phanna hear that? No matter' Patrica thought.

For Patricia has already recognized that this could very well be her final battle.

At first, Patricia just unsure of what to do but after hearing from Amanda, about the events of the exams, it' became clear to her that something must be done.

Yet as things unfolded, it became clear that Phanna had to be eleminated, not only to correct a wrong but also to protect the colony.

And now, she was ready to attack.

Patricia signaled to her team with her hands.

'I attack first. Engage after me quickly. Request backup when I engage.'

Now all Patricia had to do was wait for her command to be relayed to the rest of the party.

"I owe you no explanations" Patricia called out to Phanna finally.

Just this act alone was one of the most difficult things Patricia felt like she had ever done.

'Will I be able to attack? No, I have to take the lead. If I don't, no one else can' Patricia thought to herself.

"Is that so? Well if you're aiming to kill me the you should have done so quickly and in secret before my self defense system activated. Now that it's active, there's probably no chance for any of you to succeed I'll give you a bit of help however, here let me blindfold myself"

And without a second thought, Phanna tore off a piece of their shirt and tied it around their eyes.

"By the way, make sure to vaporize my spinal colum if you do manage to incapacitate me."
