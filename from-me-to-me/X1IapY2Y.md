"Phanna, why did you show her this?" I asked in anger.

I didn't want Melody to know about this part of our past.

I didn't want her to have to go through this.

Yet Phanna, ever so heartless, decided to bring her here the first chance they had.

"How could you do this? She didn't need to see this, she doesn't need live with this burden! How could you? Why did you..." I continued.

But my voice is faltering.

"... Because... she deserves to know the truth." Phanna answered in an unsure tone that felt alien coming of Phanna's lips.

Was Phanna unsure of the decision they made?

"Sometimes... It's better not knowing the truth." I lemented.

"But sometimes... what's better isn't what's right..."

...

That evening, the 3 of us ate dinner in silence.

Despite my feelings, I ended up having Melody sleep in Hickory's room.

Aurora's room was destroyed by Phanna earlier so it's only fair that Phanna would be the one to use it at least till it's fully repaired, much to Pillow's dismay.

Then, at that point, we can talk about room assignments again.

Phanna, for some reason, just accepted that.

It could take a while for me to get used to a much less arguementative Phanna.
