# Difficult Decisions

"Phanna, why did you show her this?" I asked in anger.

I didn't want Melody to know about this part of our past.

I didn't want her to have to go through this.

Yet Phanna, ever so heartless, decided to bring her here the first chance they had.

"How could you do this? She didn't need to see this, she doesn't need live with this burden! How could you? Why did you..." I continued.

But my voice is faltering.

"... Because... she deserves to know the truth." Phanna answered in an unsure tone that felt alien coming of Phanna's lips.

Was Phanna unsure of the decision they made?

"Sometimes... It's better not knowing the truth." I lemented.

"But sometimes... what's better isn't what's right..."

...

That evening, the 3 of us ate dinner in silence.

Despite my feelings, I ended up having Melody sleep in Hickory's room.

Aurora's room was destroyed by Phanna earlier so it's only fair that Phanna would be the one to use it at least till it's fully repaired, much to Pillow's dismay.

Then, at that point, we can talk about room assignments again.

Phanna, for some reason, just accepted that.

It could take a while for me to get used to a much less argumentative Phanna.

As for Pillow, I decided to take keep it in the mini aquairum that was onnce in Hickory's room and moved it into my room.

leaving Pillow with Phanna was probably going to result in issues later.

As far as Melody goes, she has taken a liking to Pillow too, so, it's only a matter of time before she started doing the same thing Phanna does to Pillow.

That's why keeping Pillow with me felt like the best thing to do for Pillow's sake.

The next morning, Melody joined me for breakfast.

This was yet another thing I had to get used to.

"Where's mr. Phanna?" Melody asked.

"Phanna doesn't normally wake up till very late in the day. At this point, I'm pretty sure Phanna's at least partially vampire." I sighed.

"I see... Do you happen to know what mr. Phanna is exactly?"

"Not really. I was just told 'human' and among other strange things."

"That's basically what mr. Phanna told my sister Amanda during the exam." 

"I guess that probably means Phanna at the very least believes in whatever they're saying. That or there's a reason for hiding this information from us."

"Why would mr. Phanna do that?"

"Not sure" I sighed in response before I continued on from the small talk.

I handed Melody a tray of food from yesterday's hunt and moved onto the topic that I truely wanted to discuss.

Although Phanna being mostly nocturnal was rather annoying most of the time, this was the one few times where Phanna being nocturnal turned out to be a positive thing for me.

"Melody, what do you plan on doing from now on?" I asked watching her eat. 

Melody froze up in the middle of her eating upon hearing my question.

Seeing this, I realized that I probably should have asked her this question after she had finished her food.

"I don't... know..."

"I summoned you so you are my responsibility now so you stay for as long as you like."

Melody gave me a weak nod at my statement as I continued.

"Since I summoned you, I think you deserve to know why. i'm trying to save my daughter Hickory."

Melody let out a gasp at this statement unlike Phanna which was kind of a relief.

"You mean... the Phantom Lord of Power...?" Melody asked hesitantly

"Oh, so you know about her?" I asked in surprise.

But Melody shook her head at my query.

"No one really knows the names of any of the Phantom Lords. But ever since you appeared at our settlement during the pre-exam trials, the colony leaders has been fearful of you and has been gathering information about you. That's how we found out that you were somehow connected to the Phantom Lord of Power."

"I see... no wonder the elves are the most influential humanoids. Yes, the Phantom Lord of Power is my daughter and I'm sure one day, she'd end up in some kind of confrontation with the Mastery League... It is my duty as a father and as a Master of the Mastery League to return her to the League... But now... I'm just a weak old man." I finished with a sigh.
