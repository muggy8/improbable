# Difficult Decisions

"Phanna, why did you show her this?" I asked in anger.

I didn't want Melody to know about this part of our past.

I didn't want her to have to go through this.

Yet Phanna, ever so heartless, decided to bring her here the first chance they had.

"How could you do this? She didn't need to see this, she doesn't need live with this burden! How could you? Why did you..." I continued.

But my voice is faltering.

"... Because... she deserves to know the truth." Phanna answered in an unsure tone that felt alien coming of Phanna's lips.

Was Phanna unsure of the decision they made?

"Sometimes... It's better not knowing the truth." I lemented.

"But sometimes... what's better isn't what's right..."

...

That evening, the 3 of us ate dinner in silence.

Despite my feelings, I ended up having Melody sleep in Hickory's room.

Aurora's room was destroyed by Phanna earlier so it's only fair that Phanna would be the one to use it at least till it's fully repaired, much to Pillow's dismay.

Then, at that point, we can talk about room assignments again.

Phanna, for some reason, just accepted that.

It could take a while for me to get used to a much less argumentative Phanna.

As for Pillow, I decided to take keep it in the mini aquairum that was onnce in Hickory's room and moved it into my room.

leaving Pillow with Phanna was probably going to result in issues later.

As far as Melody goes, she has taken a liking to Pillow too, so, it's only a matter of time before she started doing the same thing Phanna does to Pillow.

That's why keeping Pillow with me felt like the best thing to do for Pillow's sake.

The next morning, Melody joined me for breakfast.

This was yet another thing I had to get used to.

"Where's mr. Phanna?" Melody asked.

"Phanna doesn't normally wake up till very late in the day. At this point, I'm pretty sure Phanna's at least partially vampire." I sighed.

"I see... Do you happen to know what mr. Phanna is exactly?"

"Not really. I was just told 'human' and among other strange things."

"That's basically what mr. Phanna told my sister Amanda during the exam."

"I guess that probably means Phanna at the very least believes in whatever they're saying. That or there's a reason for hiding this information from us."

"Why would mr. Phanna do that?"

"Not sure" I sighed in response before I continued on from the small talk.

I handed Melody a tray of food from yesterday's hunt and moved onto the topic that I truely wanted to discuss.

Although Phanna being mostly nocturnal was rather annoying most of the time, this was the one few times where Phanna being nocturnal turned out to be a positive thing for me.

"Melody, what do you plan on doing from now on?" I asked watching her eat.

Melody froze up in the middle of her eating upon hearing my question.

Seeing this, I realized that I probably should have asked her this question after she had finished her food.

"I don't... know..."

"I summoned you so you are my responsibility now so you stay for as long as you like."

Melody gave me a weak nod at my statement as I continued.

"Since I summoned you, I think you deserve to know why. i'm trying to save my daughter Hickory."

Melody let out a gasp at this statement unlike Phanna which was kind of a relief.

"You mean... the Phantom Lord of Extinction...?" Melody asked hesitantly

"Oh, so you know about her?" I asked in surprise.

But Melody shook her head at my query.

"No one really knows the names of any of the Phantom Lords. But ever since you appeared at our settlement during the pre-exam trials, the colony leaders has been fearful of you and has been gathering information about you. That's how we found out that you were somehow connected to the Phantom Lord of Extinction."

"I see... no wonder the elves are the most influential humanoids. Yes, the Phantom Lord of Extinction is my daughter and I'm sure one day, she'd end up in some kind of confrontation with the Mastery League... It is my duty as a father and as a Master of the Mastery League to return her to the League... But now... I'm just a weak old man." I sighed.

As much as it hurts to admit, I'm nothing but an old man now.

I'm much too far past my prime to be anything more than just a mentor.

"This is why I'm summoning Champions, Hero's or whatever else you want to be called. At least that's my goal when I was summoning you. But no matter what I do and how I look at it, asking you to potentially face my daughter seems like the wrong thing to do. That's why I want to ask you, What do you want to do from now on?"

As much as I want to save my daughter, asking Melody for help is just like sending her off to die.

I know that she herself likely wouldn't be too bothered by it but knowing what she now knows and knowing what improbable events would have had to happen in her past to bring her here today, asking her to potentially die for my goals is something that I just can't do.

In fact, even if she does somehow decide to assist my mission of trying to get Hickory to rejoin the League of Mastery again, I would likely still be hesitant on relying on her.

Hickory's title of 'Phantom Lord of Extinction' isn't just for show.

Hickory alone could very well cause the extinction of entire group of humanoids with few exceptions should she wish for it.

The only reason she hasn't done that is probably because of the time she spent as a Grandmaster and the values me and Aurora had passed on to her she she was still a child.

Asking anyone regardless of especially Melody or even Phanna for assistance in facing down opposition like this is something that I know to be wrong.

Yet despite that, this is something I felt like I must do.

It was as if  something inside me was willing me into action no matter what.

The worst part is, I knew what that thing willing me into action is: my desire to find some form of meaning the events that happened on that day and my desire to protect the only thing that I have left of my family.

Is what I'm doing that wrong?

Thought like these swirled around my mind as I waited for Melody's response.

"I... don't know... yet..." was the strangely unexpected but also comforting answer that from Melody.

"I see. Well you're welcome to stay here for as long as you need to figure it out." I replied.

That was the only thing I could do and say that felt 'right' in the current situation.

"Does mr. Phanna know about your goal?"

"Yes."

At my answer, Melody slowly turned her gaze towards the room Phanna's currently sleeping in with an expression that, on the surface, looked liked discontent but knowing her now, I realized it must have been a mix between jealousy and admiration.

"Just so you know. Phanna doesn't know about how Powerful Hickory is." I said trying to ease the pain in Melody's heart.

Hearing my words, Melody immediately snapped her attention back to me asking "Really?"

I answered with a nod as I noticed that Melody seemed to have relaxed a bit.

I guess even someone like Phanna would have people who look up to them.

I grabbed the empty food trays from the table and moved over to the cooking area and cleaned them off with the method Ethan taught me years ago.

Melody observed me as I did this using not only her eyes but likely also her Abilities.

I didn't have Investigation active but I had a feeling that she did.

As if to confirm my suspicion, Melody asked after a short while.

"What's that Ability you're using?"

"Vibrate. It shakes things so I often use it when I'm cleaning." I answered without hesitation.

"W-would you be willing to teach me that ability? I-I might not be very useful most of the times but I can at least manage small tasks like this..."

"I wouldn't mind... but I think it's probably best for you to master Influence Manipulation more before you start tryino to learn quality of life Abilities like Vibration and such."

"T-true..." Melody said hesitantly.

"Here let me help you a bit with your practice then." I said putting the food trays away.

Melody's face lit up with surprise at my suggestion.

But immediately after, she started shaking her head.

"N-no I cant bother you like that Master Mikay. I-I'll go find somewhere out of the way and practice on my own." said Melody as she quickly made her way to the door.

But I grabbed her before she could even put on her shoes which caused Melody to let out a weak yelp.

"You probably shouldn't be going outside..." I said hesitantly.

It took a while for Melody to catch what I was saying but once she did, she started making her way back to the living room.

"S-sorry Master Mikay..." Melody appoligized softly. "I-It has completely slipped my mind... I'm sorry"

"Don't worry about it. I'm sure we'll find a way around this situation." I said trying to comfort her.

Melody was supposed to be dead. 

It would definitely cause some kind of issue for the rest of the residents of Mountainpass if Melody started showing up out of nowhere again.

In fact, what Phanna did yesterday was still weighing on my mind.

In times like this, I really wish I knew the methods that the person from the Mastery League's Headquarters used to alter the memories of others.

But that's not something I could do.

I made my way back over to Melody. 

She took up the same seat she did during breakfast and so did I as I found myself sitting across from her.

For good measure, I activated Inspection and noticed that Melody also had an ability active.

The ability was an observation type ability which probably means she's using Investigation.

Soon enough, however, I could see her ability deactivate.

"Need some help with your practice?" I asked.

Melody gave me an embarrassed nod.

"Then let me try something. Permission for Influence Extention?" I asked.

My proposal shocked melody a bit.

I'm sure she knows what I'm asking for and the dangers it entails.

"Wh-why are you requesting to control my Spere of Influence?" Melody asked hesitantly.

Hearing this, I giggled slightly as I proceeded to speak.

"Good, you pass. Don't just let anyone control your Sphere of Influence no matter how much you trust them. As for why, so you can experience what it feels like to use Abilities properly. This way, you can aim for that feeling when you practice on your own."

Surprise was written all over Melody's face and she immediately granted me permission to use her Sphere of Influence after.

I spent the rest of the day until Phanna woke up practicing abilities with Melody.

This, too, brought back memories of my time fathering Hickory. 

We would often practice using Abilities around the food table like this.

Of course, that didn't last long and she ended up mastering Influence Manipulation well before she started schooling at what is now Ethan's School.

Part of me knows that all I'm doing right now is using Melody as a replacement for Hickory, yet another part of me refused to accept this.

Is what I'm doing that bad of a thing?

I'm helping her after all.

I can't be using her in such a way right?

And even If I was, I'm still helping someone.

Before I knew it, Phanna woke up.

"Just out of curiosity, exactly how old are the two of you" Phanna asked out of nowhere shortly after waking up.

"63" I answered.

"7" answered Melody surprising me.

"Really? You look like you'd be at least 14" I blurted in surprise.

But Phanna didn't seem the least bit surprised at all.

"How long is a year? just for reference." Phanna continued as if all is normal.

Melody's respoded with confusion. 

As for me, I was rather used to Phanna's strangeness that I didn't bat it a second thought and answered.
n
"What type of year?" I Asked back.

"Um... well every?" Phanna answered a seemingly a bit confused as well.

"There's 2 type of years, seasonal years and solstace years. Seasonal years are 768 days long and lasts all 4 seasons. The solstace year marks the time between the solstace of day and the solstace of night which means the solstace year is 384 days. The solstace of night also happens to marke a new seasonal new year. That said, the seasonal year is rarely ever used. Satisfied?"

"So your age is counted in solstace years correct?"

"Yes, that would be correct." I answered.

"Hmmm... and the current date?"

"March 10th after the solstace of day."

"No year number or name?"

"Hmm? What's that?" I asked.

That's when Melody interjected.

"Um... well... it's year number 136 of my colony..." 

"And that's based on solstace years?" Phanna asked seeming a bit intriegued.

"Um, no, that's one of the few things that's based on the seasonal years."

Hmmm..."

Phanina somehow ended up lost in thought after Melody's answer but I was just glad this monversation ended before it got too out of wack.

But just as I thought that, as if to spite my optimism, Phanna spoke out again.

"This make too much sense!" Phanna yelled.

"What" Melody and I chorused in confusion and disbelief.
