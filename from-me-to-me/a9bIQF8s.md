# Nightfall

"Continue!" I demanded.

But Phanna only shook his head and pulled his arms away from my neck.

"I can't tell you what you should live for. That's something for you to decide on your own, not me. But I can tell you that you do have something to live for, otherwise, you wouldn't have stopped me." 

Why....

Why did I?

What did i?

I can't think...

I looked emptily into Phanna's eyes unsure of what I myself was even thinking or feeling.

"I've already killed you once, please don't make me do it again." Phanna said as if replying to my gaze.

But that only confused me more.

I felt my jaw drop and my eyes twitch as I failed to understand the meaning of those words.

"Phanna, please stop... whatever it is that you're doing. Melody is clearly not taking it too well."

Mikay's words, too, completely washed over me as none of it made any sense.

For some raeason, Phanna reluctantly responded to Mikay's words and stood up, rubbed my head and left the glass box.

Mikay was quick to follow behind phanna in leaving the box.

Soon enough, I was all alone in this room. 

...

I felt something squishy pushing into me causing me to look down at the cause.

There was a translucent blob around the size of my head by my side. 

What was this thing?

I picked it up fom the ground and hugged it like I would a pet.

It somehow felt comforting despite how cold it was to the touch.

But at this point, any comfort was better than none.

I sat there sitting, hugging, thinking.

What did I just experience?

What am I supposed to live for?

Why did I stop him?

What was I thinking?

Killed me once already?

None of it made any sense. 

Nothing made any sense.

As I sat there, I curled up more hugging the blob. 

The blob flet soft and squishy. 

Like water, it molded it's shape against my body giving providing a strange feeling of comfort as it wrapped itself around me as I did around it.

It really does feel nice. I thought to myself.

I could also feel the strange sensation of something inside it moved around much like flowing water.

Yet unlike water, it didn't expload or burst onto me nor did it get absorbed into my clothing.

It is indeed a strange thing.

I wonder where Phanna got it from.

The more I hugged the blob, the more I felt my mind wonder. 

And as my mind wondered, my feelings of dread and self loathing also devolved slightly. 

I'll have to ask Phanna what he means by killing me twice sometime...

Relaxing my grip on the blob a bit, I looked up out of my glass box only to find Phanna sitting on the bed across from the glass box I was in.

He was no longer wearing the strange frilly torn outfit that he was wearing earlier and instead was wearing some strangely shaped shirt and shorts that didn't reach his knees.

These clothing looked strangely loose, comfortable, and flimsy and giving Phanna a playful look.

I immediately contrasted Phanna's appearance against mine.

I was wearing my usual hunting gear, chest armor, long leggings and what would have been travel boots.

Yet despite how much better equiped I am than Phanna, I still couldn't shake the feeling that even in this way, I was inferior to him.

Maybe that playful careless look is what makes him so feel much more powerful and capable.

Having noticed my gaze, Phanna turned his head towards me.

"Feeling a bit better now?" Phanna asked.

I gave him a weak nod.

"I feel a bit bad for asking this since you're kinda in the rut right now but can you give me a bit of assistance"

I was a bit taken by surprised by Phanna's request.

Why would someone like Phanna need my help with anything?

"Uh-um sure... What do you need help with?"

"I'd like to take a bath but I have no idea how to warm the water. The other thing is, it doesn't seem that I'd be able to opperate the water pump here with my arms in the shape they are right now" Phanna said holding up his arms.

There were giant wounds on his arms in the shape of hands from when Master Mikay was trying to remove his grip on me.

"I... I'm sorry" I said instinctively as I scrambled to my feet and got out of the glass box.

"No, I'm sorry" Phanna replied immediately.

As I fully made my way out of the glass box, Phanna began speaking once more.

"I really wanted to help you way back durig the exam. But it turned into this twisted situation."

Phanna seemed so sincere in the way he spoke it took me by surprise.

I wasn't even sure if there was anything that even Phanna could have done to help me then, but my curiosity got the best of me.

"Wh-why?  Why did you want to help me?" I asked.

"I don't know, I saw a bit of myself in you I guess."

What part of Phanna could he see in a failure like me...

Well I guess I did try to end my own life...

"I... I see..." was all I was able to muster up as Phanna lead me to the bathroom down the hallway.

Inside the bathroom, I saw a strange looking rod sticking out of the ground with another one attached to the top of it near the center of the wall to our side.

It seemed like the rest of the room was build around this singular pipe with a barrle to the back and a shallow water container closer to the door.

There was another strange thing on the opposit wall offacing the tube sticking out of hte gorund that seemed to be for sitting on but I couldn't quite fgure out what it was or what it was for.

"Melody, can you fill the barrle there with water and heat it up?" Phanna asked.

"H-How?"

"Oh, that thing there is a water source of some kind. I saw Mikay draw some water out of it a while back. I think you're supposed to move the leaver up and down to to get water out I think." said Phanna pointing to the wet pipe with the werid handle by the wall.

I walked over to the pipe and started moving the handle up and down.

It was heavy, I could barely lift it up but I gave it my best anyways.

Soon enough, water was flowing slowy out of the pipe and onto the floor.

"Ah!" I yelped.

"Oh right, I think you need to connect that to the top to get water to where it needs to go" said Phanna pointing what seemed like a rope beneeth the shallow bow.

I followed Phanna's instructions and attached one end to the top of the pipe and threw the other end into the barrle and began drawing water once again.

After a short while, I was exhausted and sat down on the chair looking thing on the other side to catch my breath.

"Wh... What happened to Master Mikay" I asked completely out of breath.

I haven't seen him around since he left the room with the glass box earlier and I had a feeling that he wasn't around right now.

"he went out to get some food or something like that." answered Phanna looking into the barrel.

"I see..."
