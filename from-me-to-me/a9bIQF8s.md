# Nightfall

"Continue!" I demanded.

But Phanna only shook his head and pulled his arms away from my neck.

"I can't tell you what you should live for. That's something for you to decide on your own, not me. But I can tell you that you do have something to live for, otherwise, you wouldn't have stopped me." 

Why....

Why did I?

What did i?

I can't think...

I looked emptily into Phanna's eyes unsure of what I myself was even thinking or feeling.

"I've already killed you once, please don't make me do it again." Phanna said as if replying to my gaze.

But that only confused me more.

I felt my jaw drop and my eyes twitch as I failed to understand the meaning of those words.

"Phanna, please stop... whatever it is that you're doing. Melody is clearly not taking it too well."

Mikay's words, too, completely washed over me as none of it made any sense.

For some raeason, Phanna reluctantly responded to Mikay's words and stood up, rubbed my head and left the glass box.

Mikay was quick to follow behind phanna in leaving the box.

Soon enough, I was all alone in this room. 

...

I felt something squishy pushing into me causing me to look down at the cause.

There was a translucent blob around the size of my head by my side. 

What was this thing?

I picked it up fom the ground and hugged it like I would a pet.

It somehow felt comforting despite how cold it was to the touch.

But at this point, any comfort was better than none.

I sat there sitting, hugging, thinking.

What did I just experiance?

What am I supposed to live for?

Why did I stop him?

What was I thining?

Killed me once already?

None of it made any sense. 

Nothing made any sense.

As I sat there, I curled up more around the blob.
