# Nightfall

"Continue!" I demanded.

But Phanna only shook his head and pulled his arms away from my neck.

"I can't tell you what you should live for. That's something for you to decide on your own, not me. But I can tell you that you do have something to live for, otherwise, you wouldn't have stopped me." 

Why....

Why did I?

What did i?

I can't think...

I looked emptily into Phanna's eyes unsure of what I myself was even thinking or feeling.

"I've already killed you once, please don't make me do it again." Phanna said as if replying to my gaze.

But that only confused me more.

I felt my jaw drop and my eyes twitch as I failed to understand the meaning of those words.

"Phanna, please stop... whatever it is that you're doing. Melody is clearly not taking it too well."

Mikay's words, too, completely washed over me as none of it made any sense.

For some raeason, Phanna reluctantly responded to Mikay's words and stood up, rubbed my head and left the glass box.

Mikay was quick to follow behind phanna in leaving the box.

Soon enough, I was all alone in this room. 

...

I felt something squishy pushing into me causing me to look down at the cause.

There was a translucent blob around the size of my head by my side. 

What was this thing?

I picked it up fom the ground and hugged it like I would a pet.

It somehow felt comforting despite how cold it was to the touch.

But at this point, any comfort was better than none.

I sat there sitting, hugging, thinking.

What did I just experience?

What am I supposed to live for?

Why did I stop him?

What was I thinking?

Killed me once already?

None of it made any sense. 

Nothing made any sense.

As I sat there, I curled up more hugging the blob. 

The blob flet soft and squishy. 

Like water, it molded it's shape against my body giving providing a strange feeling of comfort as it wrapped itself around me as I did around it.

It really does feel nice. I thought to myself.

I could also feel the strange sensation of something inside it moved around much like flowing water.

Yet unlike water, it didn't expload or burst onto me nor did it get absorbed into my clothing.

It is indeed a strange thing.

I wonder where Phanna got it from.

The more I hugged the blob, the more I felt my mind wonder. 

And as my mind wondered, my feelings of dread and self loathing also devolved slightly. 

I'll have to ask Phanna what he means by killing me twice sometime...

Relaxing my grip on the blob a bit, I looked up out of my glass box only to find Phanna sitting on the bed across from the glass box I was in.

He was no longer wearing the strange frilly torn outfit that he was wearing earlier and instead was wearing some strangely shaped shirt and shorts that didn't reach his knees.

These clothing looked strangely loose, comfortable, and flimsy and giving Phanna a playful look.

I immediately contrasted Phanna's appearance against mine.

I was wearing my usual hunting gear, chest armor, long leggings and what would have been travel boots.

Yet despite how much better equiped I am than Phanna, I still couldn't shake the feeling that even in this way, I was inferior to him.

Maybe that playful careless look is what makes him so feel much more powerful and capable.

Having noticed my gaze, Phanna turned his head towards me.

"Hey Melody, can you give me a bit of assistance"

I was a bit taken by surprised by Phanna's request.

Why would someone like Phanna need my help with anything?

"Uh-um sure... What do you need help with?"

"I'd like to take a bath but I have no idea how to warm the water. The other thing is, it doesn't seem that I'd be able to opperate the water pump here with my arms in the shape they are right now" Phanna said holding up his arms.

There were giant wounds on his arms in the shape of hands from when Master Mikay was trying to remove his grip on me.

"I... I'm sorry" I said instinctively as I scrambled to my feet and got out of the glass box.

"No, I'm sorry" Phanna replied immediately.

As I fully made my way out of the glass box, Phanna began speaking once more.
