# Nightfall

"Continue!" I demanded.

But Phanna only shook his head and pulled his arms away from my neck.

"I can't tell you what you should live for. That's something for you to decide on your own, not me. But I can tell you that you do have something to live for, otherwise, you wouldn't have stopped me." 

Why....

Why did I?

What did i?

I can't think...

I looked emptily into Phanna's eyes unsure of what I myself was even thinking or feeling.

Slowly, Phanna stood up, rubbed my head and left the glass box saying.

"I'll give you some time to think things through yourself."

At Phanna's voice, Mikay quickly followed behind phanna and left the box.

Soon enough, I was all alone in this room. 

...

I felt something squishy pushing into me causing me to look down at the cause.

There was a translucent blob around the size of my head by my side. 

What was this thing?

I picked it up fom the ground and hugged it like I would a pet.

It somehow felt comforting despite how cold it was to the touch.

But at this point, any comfort was better than none.

I sat there sitting, hugging, thinking.

What did I just experience?

What am I supposed to live for?

What do I have to live for?

Why did I stop him?

What was I thinking?

If only I could relive that instant again.

What would I have done if I had the chance?

Would I have stopped Phanna again if that happened.

I didn't know the answer but I had a feeling that I were to relive those events again without knowing what I did now, I would have made the same choices.

But why?

What DO I have to live for?

I've spent my whole life as the laughing stock of the my party and made my party the laughting stock of the whole tribe.

If it wasn't for me, our party wouldn't be seen as the failure of our elven colony.

All I've ever been was missfortune.

All I've ever been was a waste of resources. 

I'd always did was get myself into trouble, endanger everyone else in my party, even cause us to lose our catch time and time again.

No, I didn't just endanger my party, I caused harm to my party from my incomptiance.

I caused our catch to go free.

I caused our party to go hungry.

I'm always causing trouble, I'm alwasy getting scolded.

I dont even remember the last time I did something and wasn't scolded for it.

In fact, I don't even remmeber the last day where I wasn't scolded for something.

I'm such a failure.

It's all my fault.

I've done nothing good.

Yet here I am even now.

What have I done in my life that would make this life worth living?

What did I have to live for?

No, what DO I have to live for?

None of it made any sense. 

Nothing made any sense.

As I sat there, I curled up more hugging the blob. 

The blob flet soft and squishy. 

Like water, it molded it's shape against my body giving providing a strange feeling of comfort as it wrapped itself around me as I did around it.

It really does feel nice. I thought to myself.

I could also feel the strange sensation of something inside it moved around much like flowing water.

Yet unlike water, it didn't expload or burst onto me nor did it get absorbed into my clothing.

It is indeed a strange thing.

I wonder where Phanna got it from.

The more I hugged the blob, the more I felt my mind wonder. 

And as my mind wondered, my feelings of dread and self loathing also devolved slightly. 

I'll have to ask Phanna what he means by killing me twice sometime...

Relaxing my grip on the blob a bit, I looked up out of my glass box only to find Phanna sitting on the bed across from the glass box I was in.

He was no longer wearing the strange frilly torn outfit that he was wearing earlier and instead was wearing some strangely shaped shirt and shorts that didn't reach his knees with what seemed to be longer sleeved pants under the shorts.

These clothing looked strangely loose, comfortable, and flimsy and giving Phanna a playful look.

I immediately contrasted Phanna's appearance against mine.

I was wearing my usual hunting gear, chest armor, long leggings and what would have been travel boots.

Yet despite how much better equiped I am than Phanna, I still couldn't shake the feeling that even in this way, I was inferior to him.

Maybe that playful careless look is what makes him so feel much more powerful and capable.

Having noticed my gaze, Phanna turned his head towards me.

"Feeling a bit better now?" Phanna asked.

I gave him a weak nod.

"I feel a bit bad for asking this since you're kinda in the rut right now but can you give me a bit of assistance"

I was a bit taken by surprised by Phanna's request.

Why would someone like Phanna need my help with anything?

"Uh-um sure... What do you need help with?"

"I'd like to take a bath but I have no idea how to warm the water. The other thing is, it doesn't seem that I'd be able to opperate the water pump here with my arms in the shape they are right now" Phanna said holding up his arms.

There were giant wounds on his arms in the shape of hands from when Master Mikay was trying to remove his grip on me.

"I... I'm sorry" I said instinctively as I scrambled to my feet and got out of the glass box.

"No, I'm sorry" Phanna replied immediately.

As I fully made my way out of the glass box, Phanna began speaking once more.

"I really wanted to help you way back durig the exam. But it turned into this twisted situation."

Phanna seemed so sincere in the way he spoke it took me by surprise.

I wasn't even sure if there was anything that even Phanna could have done to help me then, but my curiosity got the best of me.

"Wh-why?  Why did you want to help me?" I asked.

"I don't know, I saw a bit of myself in you I guess."

What part of Phanna could he see in a failure like me...

Well I guess I did try to end my own life...

"I... I see..." was all I was able to muster up as Phanna lead me to the bathroom down the hallway.

Inside the bathroom, I saw a strange looking rod sticking out of the ground with another one attached to the top of it near the center of the wall to our side.

It seemed like the rest of the room was build around this singular pipe with a barrle to the back and a shallow water container closer to the door.

There was another strange thing on the opposit wall offacing the tube sticking out of hte gorund that seemed to be for sitting on but I couldn't quite fgure out what it was or what it was for.

"Melody, can you fill the barrle there with water and heat it up?" Phanna asked.

"H-How?"

"Oh, that thing there is a water source of some kind. I saw Mikay draw some water out of it a while back. I think you're supposed to move the leaver up and down to to get water out I think." said Phanna pointing to the wet pipe with the werid handle by the wall.

I walked over to the pipe and started moving the handle up and down.

It was heavy, I could barely lift it up but I gave it my best anyways.

Soon enough, water was flowing slowy out of the pipe and onto the floor.

"Ah!" I yelped.

"Oh right, I think you need to connect that to the top to get water to where it needs to go" said Phanna pointing what seemed like a rope beneeth the shallow bow.

I followed Phanna's instructions and attached one end to the top of the pipe and threw the other end into the barrle and began drawing water once again.

After a short while, I was exhausted and sat down on the chair looking thing on the other side to catch my breath.

"Wh... What happened to Master Mikay" I asked completely out of breath.

I haven't seen him around since he left the room with the glass box earlier and I had a feeling that he wasn't around right now.

"he went out to get some food or something like that." answered Phanna looking into the barrel.

"I see..."

...

"Does it hurt?" I asked Phanna as I finished filling the barrel with water.

"Ah, This?" Phanna asked lookinging at at his arms before continueing, "It's ok, It stings a little but it's  healing already. I've disabled most of the pain receptors in the area since they aren't exactly useful right now."

"So it doesn't hurt?"

"Well it does, but I don't really feel most of it right now."

"I see..."

After hearing my reply, Phanna dipped his face into the water before lifting it out again.

"Ah what are you doing?" I said in surprise.

"Just checking the tempreture of the water. I cant really use my arms or hands for anything right now so my face will kind of have to do."

I was still a bit confused but I had a general idea of what was happening.

"That said, it is a bit cold for my liking, Not sure if you can heat it up for me. Though I kind of feel bad for asking so much of you."

"Oh, Um, sure." I answered.

I guess Phanna really isn't able to use Abilities at all. I thought as I walked close enough to the barrel to cover it entirely in my Sphere of Influence.

Once the barrel was fully within my Sphere of Influence, I activated Heat and warmed up the water rapidly until a bit of steam was coming off the top of the barrel.

"Hmm..." was the only thing that Phanna said during the whole process.

"I think it sould be warm enough." I said once I reached the limit for how long I can keep an ability active.

"Thanks," Phanna replied as he dipped his face into the water again.

"Perfect!"

And with that, Phanna got into the barrel with all of his cloths still on.

"Ah, your cloths!" I yelped in surprise for who knows how many times it's been already.

"What about them?" Phanna asked looking a bit confused with his arms hanging over the side of the barrel.

"They're all wet now..."

"Ya so?"

"Isn't that uncomfortable? And wont they take a long time to dry? You're going to catch a cold after too if you wear wet cloths around."

"Huh?" Phanna seemed really confused by my question.

"Um... Uhhh...." I was lost for words and it seems like Phanna was too.

"Um... Please enjoy your bath!" I said a little embarrased as I quickly existed the bathroom.
