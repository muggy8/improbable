# Title WiP

"All of you! Stop!" I yelled in a commanding voice as I arrived at the location Melody guided me to.

The scene before me was perfectly described by a single word: battlefield.

Bodies lay lifeless on the ground all over.

All of them were elves as far as I could tell.

This wasn't a scene that I was all too unfamiliar with but I also wasn't comfortable with it either.

I would have believed that the battle was over if not for the group of elves darting around on the ground.

At my call, the group seemed to have came to a standstill and all of them turned to face me except for one.

Unlike the rest of the elves, Phanna seemed to be completely aware of my entrance and presence despite being blindfolded for some reason.

"Phanna! What are you doing?" I asked despite already having a fair idea of what's going on.

Melody has already explained what she knew to me and is currently standing a bit further back to observe the situation.

It seems that the elves had misunderstood something and is attacking phanna because of it.

That said, my goal isn't to find out the truth or anything; instead, it's to stop the fighting.

Given the current state of the battlefield, getting Phanna under control was the most important since Phanna's strenght still rather mysterious even now. 

If things go poorly, I am confident in my ability to deal with Phanna myself but I'd like to avoid that if possible.

Judging by the number of bodies on the ground, an honest fight against Phanna will be very costly.

That's why my focus has been on Phanna from the start. 

That said, I am also keeping an eye on the elves that are around.

They probably don't pose a threat to me at all considering how much they're strugling with Phanna but a surprise attack is still a posibility.

It's not entirely impossiable that they'd use Phanna as bait to lure me here and I end up being their true targets. 

After a brief moment of slience, Phanna finally answered my question.

"As you can see, I'm being attacked."

"It sure doesn't look that way. There's bodies scattered all around us."

"Fighting back when being attacked is a pretty natrual thing to do right?"

"Are you saying you didn't start the fight?"

"Yup." Phanna said with much confidence.

Phanna's answer pretty much lined up with what Melody has told me already.

I had wished that maybe Phanna started something but that was just wishful thinking it seems.

Before the silence got any longer, someone else spoke up.

"Master Mikay, with all due respect, This matter is between us and Phanna. Although it may anger you, we cannot afford to let Phanna live. We would like to ask you to ask you not to interfear with us during this process."

The voice did not come from anyone within the group of elves or Phanna, instead, it came from somewhere far to my left.

As I turned my gaze towards the source of the voice, my eyes met with yet another female elf dressed in thick wooden armor unlike the rest of the elves.

"Would you be able to explain the reason?" I asked in response to her declration.

"You see, we have reason to believe that Phanna is an elf queen and will likely start a colony soon within Mountainpass. We are unsure of she has done to gain your favor, however, this is a matter of life and death here for us so please allow us the dignity to fight for our survival."

Survial? That sure sounds serious...

"I'm sorry but I don't quite understand. How is Phanna a threat to you elves?"

"Ah? odd... Well all of us elves here are born of a single mother who's generally known as a queen. Phanna here is also one such queen and if we allow her to do as she pleases, she will eventually give birth to another elven colony near by. Our colony and hers is sure to go to war at that time. That's why, as the first elven group to set up in this area, we are simply excercising our right to self preservation."

Before I could fully process what was explained to me, Phanna broke into our conversation.

"Is that so? Then why do you refuse to at the very least hear what I have to say?" Phanna said with a glare despite being blindfolded.

"Sure, I'd be happy to find eternal rest but the way you all are going about it is completely off and is simply a waist of time and energy."

"Quiet you murderer!" Yelled the armored elf warrior but Phanna paid her no mind and continued.

"If all you care about is the elimination of a competing queen then I'm not your target. I don't have the biological means to reproduce in any way yet here you are wasting my time and energy. All I want is some of the rocks over there but here I am stuck with dealing with you lot over some stupid assumptions."

"Enough! You think we'd believe a word you say? You killed one of our own without a second thought in the exams which was supposed to be non-lethal. It'd be foolish to believe anything you say!"

It took me a moment to understand the true weight of those words as I fell into silence.

It wasn't just a simple missunderstanding, jnst controlling Phanna was no longer the solution, and most importantly, I was now also part of the problem.

My failure to prevent Melody's death during the exam sure has spiraled into something much bigger.

"I'm... Sorry..." I muttered as I came to such realizations.

A feeling of guilt welled up within me.

Maybe I shouldn't have involved Phanna in the entrance exams of the school.

But all that is in my past now and all I can do now is to face what problems that decision may bring.

After all, that's the only thing left that I could do if I were to have a chance of rescuing my daughter.

"I'm sorry. It's my fault" I said once more, this time louder.

The armored elf warrior seemed to be a little caught off guard by my statement as I continued to speak.

"The reason Melody perished is the result of my failure to perform the duties of an examiner. Phanna did nothing wrong." I asserted.

The armored elf warrior seemed to be a bit confused at my statement but I continued.

"As an examiner and a Master, I had the power to prevent Melody's death during the exam but I failed to do that. Participants of the exams are instructed to avoid the use of lethal force but it is the job of us examiners to enforce such rules. That's why, I am the one at fault for what happened to Melody."

As I finished, I cound see the armored elf warrior eyeing me suspiciousely before exchanging gazes with the other elves.

I took a glance at Phanna as well and they didn't seem to have responded to the conversation at all.

But I know that Phanna is observing and waiting for the perfect moment to join in and take control of the conversation.

Phanna might act like an idiot normally but when it counts, they have a strangely sharp mind and sharp tung.

I turned my focus back towards the armored elf warrior as they returned their gaze back to me as well.

"Master Mikay, what does any of what you said matter?"

At this question, I glanced back towards Phanna trying to let them know that this was their chance to enter the conversation.

Yet for some reason, Phanna did not speak.

What happened?

The Phanna that was normally so sharp in these situations is having a slip up?

It can't be can it?

How could Phanna give up such an oppertunity to interject, clear up the missunderstanding, and then, control the flow of the conversation?

Phanna has done exactly that so many times so why not now?

In a hurry, I quickly returned my focus to the armored elf warrior again and answered.

"Surely, you can at least hear Phanna out before proceeding with this fight, right?"

At my suggestion, the armored elf frowned while delivering a rejection to my statement.

"Even if the fault of what happend to Melody lies with you, it doesn't change the fact that Phanna used lethal force in the first place. What reason do we have to negotiate with someone who does something they are explicitly told not to do let along beleve said person."

The armored elf warrior's remark left me speechless, I had nothing left to refute her with.

What else can I say to put a stop to this?

The elves seemed to be dead set on killing Phanna.

I don't want to lose Phanna to something like this.

I'm unsure if Phanna can get out of this alone yet if I interfeared with this, my karma would surely fall.

Is the loss in karma worth it?

Phanna has yet to prove useful in my quest to save Hickory but my gut feeling is telling me that I shouldn't abbandon Phanna right now.

What do I do? What should I say?
