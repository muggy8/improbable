# Title WiP

"All of you! Stop!" I yelled in a commanding voice as I arrived at the location Melody guided me to.

The scene before me was perfectly described by a single word: battlefield.

Bodies lay lifeless on the ground all over.

All of them were elves as far as I could tell.

This wasn't a scene that I was all too unfamiliar with but I also wasn't comfortable with it either.

I would have believed that the battle was over if not for the group of elves darting around on the ground.

At my call, the group seemed to have came to a standstill and all of them turned to face me except for one.

Unlike the rest of the elves, Phanna seemed to be completely aware of my entrance and presence despite being blindfolded for some reason.

"Phanna! What are you doing?" I asked despite already having a fair idea of what's going on.

Melody has already explained what she knew to me and is currently standing a bit further back to observe the situation.

It seems that the elves had misunderstood something and is attacking phanna because of it.

That said, my goal isn't to find out the truth or anything; instead, it's to stop the fighting.

Given the current state of the battlefield, getting Phanna under control was the most important since Phanna's strenght still rather mysterious even now. 

If things go poorly, I am confident in my ability to deal with Phanna myself but I'd like to avoid that if possible.

Judging by the number of bodies on the ground, an honest fight against Phanna will be very costly.

That's why my focus has been on Phanna from the start. 

That said, I am also keeping an eye on the elves that are around.

They probably don't pose a threat to me at all considering how much they're strugling with Phanna but a surprise attack is still a posibility.

It's not entirely impossiable that they'd use Phanna as bait to lure me here and I end up being their true targets. 

After a brief moment of slience, Phanna finally answered my question.

"As you can see, I'm being attacked."

"It sure doesn't look that way. There's bodies scattered all around us."

"Fighting back when being attacked is a pretty natrual thing to do right?"

"Are you saying you didn't start the fight?"

"Yup." Phanna said with much confidence.

Phanna's answer pretty much lined up with what Melody has told me already.

I had wished that maybe Phanna started something but that was just wishful thinking it seems.

Before the silence got any longer, someone else spoke up.

"Master Mikay, with all due respect, This matter is between us and Phanna. Although it may anger you, we cannot afford to let Phanna live. We would like to ask you to ask you not to interfear with us during this process."

The voice did not come from anyone within the group of elves or Phanna, instead, it came from somewhere far to my left.

As I turned my gaze towards the source of the voice, my eyes met with yet another female elf dressed in thick wooden armor unlike the rest of the elves.

"Would you be able to explain the reason?" I asked in response to her declration.

"You see, we have reason to believe that Phanna is an elf queen and will likely start a colony soon within Mountainpass. We are unsure of she has done to gain your favor, however, this is a matter of life and death here for us so please allow us the dignity to fight for our survival."

Survial? That sure sounds serious...

"I'm sorry but I don't quite understand. How is Phanna a threat to you elves?"

"Ah? odd... Well all of us elves here are born of a single mother who's generally known as a queen. Phanna here is also one such queen and if we allow her to do as she pleases, she will eventually give birth to another elven colony near by. Our colony and hers is sure to go to war at that time. That's why, as the first elven group to set up in this area, we are simply excercising our right to self preservation."

Before I could fully process what was explained to me, Phanna broke into our conversation.

"Is that so? Then why do you refuse to at the very least hear what I have to say?" Phanna said with a glare despite being blindfolded.

"Sure, I'd be happy to find eternal rest but right now, I'm trying to figure something out. Aside from that, your methods are completely off and is simply a waist of time and energy."

"Quiet you murderer!" Yelled the armored elf warrior but Phanna paid her no mind and continued.

"If all you care about is the elimination of a competing queen then I'm not your target. I don't have the biological means to reproduce in any way yet here you are wasting my time and energy. All I want is some of the rocks over there but here I am stuck with dealing with you lot over some stupid assumptions."

"Enough! You think we'd believe a word you say? You killed one of our own without a second thought in the exams which was supposed to be non-lethal. It'd be foolish to believe anything you say!"

It took me a moment to understand the true weight of those words as I fell into silence.

It wasn't just a simple missunderstanding, jnst controlling Phanna was no longer the solution, and most importantly, I was now also part of the problem.

My failure to prevent Melody's death during the exam sure has spiraled into something much bigger.

"I'm... Sorry..." I muttered as I came to such realizations.

A feeling of guilt welled up within me.

Maybe I shouldn't have involved Phanna in the entrance exams of the school.

But all that is in my past now and all I can do now is to face what problems that decision may bring.

After all, that's the only thing left that I could do if I were to have a chance of rescuing my daughter.

"I'm sorry. It's my fault" I said once more, this time louder.

The armored elf warrior seemed to be a little caught off guard by my statement as I continued to speak.

"The reason Melody perished is the result of my failure to perform the duties of an examiner. Phanna did nothing wrong." I asserted.

The armored elf warrior seemed to be a bit confused at my statement but I continued.

"As an examiner and a Master, I had the power to prevent Melody's death during the exam but I failed to do that. Participants of the exams are instructed to avoid the use of lethal force but it is the job of us examiners to enforce such rules. That's why, I am the one at fault for what happened to Melody."

As I finished, I cound see the armored elf warrior eyeing me suspiciousely before exchanging gazes with the other elves.

I took a glance at Phanna as well and they didn't seem to have responded to the conversation at all.

But I know that Phanna is observing and waiting for the perfect moment to join in and take control of the conversation.

Phanna might act like an idiot normally but when it counts, they have a strangely sharp mind and sharp tung.

I turned my focus back towards the armored elf warrior as they returned their gaze back to me as well.

"Master Mikay, what does any of what you said matter?"

At this question, I glanced back towards Phanna trying to let them know that this was their chance to enter the conversation.

Yet for some reason, Phanna did not speak.

What happened?

The Phanna that was normally so sharp in these situations is having a slip up?

It can't be can it?

How could Phanna give up such an oppertunity to interject, clear up the missunderstanding, and then, control the flow of the conversation?

Phanna has done exactly that so many times so why not now?

In a hurry, I quickly returned my focus to the armored elf warrior again and answered.

"Surely, you can at least hear Phanna out before proceeding with this fight, right?"

At my suggestion, the armored elf frowned while delivering a rejection to my statement.

"Even if the fault of what happend to Melody lies with you, it doesn't change the fact that Phanna used lethal force in the first place. What reason do we have to negotiate with someone who does something they are explicitly told not to do let along beleve said person."

The armored elf warrior's remark left me speechless, I had nothing left to refute her with.

What else can I say to put a stop to this?

The elves seemed to be dead set on killing Phanna.

I don't want to lose Phanna to something like this.

I'm unsure if Phanna can get out of this alone yet if I interfeared with this, my karma would surely fall.

Is the loss in karma worth it?

Phanna has yet to prove useful in my quest to save Hickory but my gut feeling is telling me that I shouldn't abbandon Phanna right now.

What do I do? What should I say?

Is there anything I can do?

Maybe I should just let them kill Phanna...

No, I cant do that, if the fighting continues then there's a good chance that the the person Melody is trying to prevent from dying will end up dead. 

I know that feeling all too well, trying to protect someone from destruction. 

So if I cant do anything to end this conflic then maybe I could do something else to prevent the worst case scenario. 

I took a deep breath as I made up my mind and began to speak.

"Alright, I guess I cant stop you from doing what you must. However, if I may, I'd like to make a selfish request. Your target is technically someone associated with me so I should at least have some say in this matter correct?"

At my words, the armored elf warrior looked at me with a grim look as she hesitantly replied to me.

"What would your request be Master Mikay?"

Alright, it seems that I have some negotiating power in this matter. 

"I would like to request all of you do your best to stay alive."

At my request, the elves around me responded with a look of surprise and confusion as I looked continued speaking.

"If things doesn't look good then please stop and find a way to survive. It does no good to anyone for you to die."

After saying that, I turned my focus towards Phanna and prepared myself for what is about to come.

"Phanna, you should hold back a bit. I know you're the one being attacked but at the very least, you should avoid killing where possible."

"I... I can't..."

"Is that so?"

"I don't have control over my body anymore. It's just like what happened with Melody during the exam."

With those words, Phanna silenced the whole forest.

It was as if the whole world was confused.

"As you know, when my life is being threatened, my body enters self-defense mode and it takes over most of my body's movements. From that point on, my body will act on it's on to ensure survival and I have little to no control over what happens from that point on."

This is the first I've heard of it actually. 

Not to mention losing control of your own body? 

That is a bit too convenient for this situation right?

But I cant say I've never experianced it before. 

When I had the communcation with the Mastery Leageu HQ, something like that did happen so I cant exactly say what Phanna is suggesting is impossiable.

As I was quickly losing myself in thought, a voice yelled out from the group of elves in protest.

"Impossiable! Don't believe a single word Phanna says. This whole self defense thing is all a lie. Her true goal is to wipe us all out and claim this territory for herself" yelled one of the elves from the crowd that was once chasing Phanna around. 

I quickly refocused my attention onto her as she continued to shouting.

"Even if we assume that this self defense mode thing exists, I know Melody personally as she was a part of my party. There was no possiable way she'd be able to do anything to threaten your life."

After she made that statement, she lowered her stance as if to ready herself to attack at a moment's notice.

Similarly, all the other elves including the armored elf warrior took up their battle stances.

Phanna, oddly enough, was the only one who didn't seem to have made any posture adjustments. 

Instead, Phanna didn't even move a muscle a the provacations.

However, the elven figthters werent the only one who moved.

Behind me, the Melody who was observing this whole situation from a safe distance tenssed up with anxiety as she looked towards the battlefield.

Her experession said it all. 

'I'm sorry, it's my fault,' 'Please stop,' 'If only I had known earlier.' It didn't take a genius to figure out what she was probably thinking.

After all, I know those feeling very well myself.

In fact, she looked like she was on the edge of jumping in and exposing herself and try to clear things up.

But I didn't want that to be the outcome netiher would Phanna.

In fact, it's unknown if the elves would even believe that this Melody is the same Melody who had died so many weeks ago nor do we know the consiquences of being known as someone who has undoutibly died and then somehow revived. 

In the best case scenario, she'd end up being treated as some sort of monster by the Mastery League and shunned for life and it only gets worse from there.

Though I don't know what Phanna is thinking, I know that at the very least, Phanna would like to keep the fact that this Melody is the same Melody that died alreayd as a secret.

That's why, I have to do everything and anything to find the result that she is looking for. 

In the worst case scenario, I'll have to knock her out to prevent her from doing anything rash. 

Unfortunately, I have no idea what I have to do stop the fighting. 

If only I could presuade the elves to stop, but I didn't have that much confidence in myself to do that. 

That means, the only thing I could do now is to give Phanna as much help as I can and hopefully, they'll be able to talk themselves out of this hole. 

Once again, I refocused attention on the elves who seems to be readying to attack and cleared my thoat. 

"It seems you're mistaken, Melody did indeed make an attempt to kill Phanna during the exam." I declared. 

With those words leaving my mouth, I could feel a signinficant change in the atmosphere as the elves started turning their gaze towards me one by one. 

"M-Master Mikay, what has Phanna done to earn your support so completely..." said the elf who was shouting at Phanna just a while back.

She seemed to be quite surprised by my statement though I couldn't quite fault her for being surprised.

"Unfortunately, I'm not exactly on Phanna's side right now."

"Then why would you say that?"

"Because it's the truth."

"How?! We saw what happened! Sure, Melody kicked Phanna first but that didn't seems to cause Phanna any damage, yet Phanna, in return..."

Her voice trailed off in the end as she was clearly hurt by the memories of such an event.

I know the feeling of losing someone as well and it must be even harder considering how young she must be.

"I'm not sure how you were watching but one thing I'm sure of is that I was much closer to the event than you were." I said.

It seems that my statement had the intened effect as no argumentative rebuttal was made by any of the elves.

However, I did receive a number of cautious looks from various members of the elves while others gave me mornful looks.

"I was located at the judging area at the time of the incident and I was observing the entire exchange between Phanna and Melody. I was particularly intrested in that fight since I wanted to see how strong Phanna is in a fight. That's why I had both Observe and Investigate active to watch the event at the time. You're right, Melody did strike first but not only did she strike with Quicken, she also aimed for Phanna's neck. I dont know how Phanna managed to survive that unscathed but they did. I wouldn't say the way Phanna fought back the right way but I also wouldn't immediately declare Phanna to be in the wrong either."

As I finished retelling the events of the exam, silence washed over the forest once again but that silence was shortly interupted.

"Is... everything you've said true..?"

The source of the question was none other than the elf who seems to have direct connection to Melody.

I gave her a nod in response to her question which made her turn her gaze away from me.

It was clear that what I said made her reconsider much of what she thought she knew about the situation. 

"Is that why you're helping Phanna right now?" the elf asked after reexamining her own assumpitions.

I wasn't exactly too sure what she was asking about but even despite that, I knew how I must answer.

"I guess you could say that, though I'm not technically on Phanna's side."

The moment when the opposition shows weakness, is one of the moment where victory can be achieved.

In these moments, by pressing the offence without showing any weakness, victory will easily come within grasping distance.

This is true no matter the encounter, with fists or with words; that's why, I must answer as if I knew what she was thinking.

By pressing my advantage, maybe I can put an end to this conflict.

"I... see..." She replied weakly before continueing, "Then... why are you helping Phanna if you're not on her side?"

"To protect you all. I don't want to see needless deaths. Phanna probably isn't any danger to you all in the way you all seem to be thinking. I was asked to stop the fighting here because someone doesn't want to see you all die. It's why I requested you all stay alive."

"Are you mocking us?!" Yelled the armored elf warrior immediately after my comment.

"look around you? Is what I'm asking really mocking you?" I snarled back silencing the armored elf warrior.

Reluctantly, the elves slowly sat down cross legged one by one.

Seeing this, I knew my job was now complete.

Sitting down is a simple yet effective way of saying that one does not intend to attack.

Afterall, attacking from a sitting position is difficult, if not impossiable.

And thus, I had finished playing my role within this conflict as I sat down too and gestured towards Phanna to do the same.
