# Investigator

"We don't want any part in whatever religion you're trying to promote" Phanna said sternly into the small gap between the door and the door frame he created by slightly opening the door 

"Um what" came an unfarmiliar voice from the other side of the door before Phanna quickly closed the door.

The person on the other side knocked again and reluctantly, Phanna opened the door only enough to peak out again.

"We also don't what whatever you're trying to sell." Phanna said again and closed the door again.

"What are you doin?" I asked.

"Turing away someone who's probably a religious fanatic or a snake oil salesmen."

"Eh... what?"

For the third time, the person out side knocked on the door and this time, he also said something along side the knocking.

"Um? Can I speak with Master Mikay?" the person outside asked.

This time, I was the one to open the door and answer.

"Uh, sorry but Master Mikay is not home at the moment" I said looking at the unexpected guest.

The person standing before me was a female Warecat.

She had long shiny silver white hair that mostly cover her left eye and cat like ears on top of her head.

She was wearing light armor like the set I normally would be wearing had I still been living with the elves but instead of just leather, her armor was plated with bones and seems to fit her very well.

She even had turtle shells as knee and elbow guards. 

"Oh, is that so... Do you happen to know when he might be back" she asked.

"Unfortunately, I don't." I answered.

"I see. I'll try back tomorrow"

"He likely won't be here either" Phanna interjected.

"What? Why's that?" the cat lady asked.

"He got suckered into being a 'private instructor' for some elves and today happens to be his first day on the job. We don't know when he'll be back but he likely won't be home all that often from now on." Phanna answered.

"I don't think 'suckered' is the best way to put it..." I sighed

"But it's not wrong either right?" Phanna said smugly in the tone he often uses when speaking to Mikay.

The cat lady seeing us giggled at our exchange before she spoke again.

"I see. Would you mind if I stayed here and wait for his return?"

"Huh? Why?" Phanna asked.

"I'm here from Starfall to investigate the incident during the Mastery League's entrance exam here in Mountainpass on Feburary 32nd."

At her declration, I froze up as if I was looking at a cold hearted killer.

Despite knowing that I now looked nothing like the Melody who died, I couldn't shake the feeling that she was here to expose me for who I am.

But, I am Melody.

I'm supposed to be dead in this world.

What if she finds out?

But there's no way the cat lady could make the connection right?

"Sure, feel free to wait whatever you like outside" Phanna answered before closing the door.

"What?!" was all the cat lady managed th say before the door closed.

"Um... are you sure that what you did was a good idea?" I asked still a bit shaken.

"Sure it is. We don't need another person to fight for Pillow and Cushen." Phanna joked.

Again, I couldn't tell if Phanna was serious or not.

He dragged me to my room and placed Pillow and Cushen into my arms and dashed off to somewhere else.

"W-what are you doing?" I asked.

"I have to do some cleaning up. You play with Pillow and Cushen." Phanna answered.

After that, I was alone with just my thoughts and 2 adorable blobs bouncing around me.

Judging by her bone plated light armor, she must be either very powerful or not every important.

Most important people in the elven colony wear full body armor when conducting field duties. 

The only exception are the Masters and Grandmasters since armor only slow them down so they end up wearing light armor again sometimes.

No no, I can't apply elven logic to other humanoid races...

Phanna is an example of that.

Nothing I know or think is normal applies to him and he's half elf.

Other races who have nothing in common with elves will are likely even more different.

At that moment, the scent of something burning assaulted my nose.

Fire!!!

My mind immediately went into panic mode.

This is bad.

If there's a fire somewhere, it's going to spread and consume everything.

EVERYTHING! 

The mountain, my party, the colony, everything!

I have to stop it!

I quickly swung my door open only to immediately catch sight of the source of the burning scent.

Phanna was staring into the bathing barrel that was now full of fire within the washroom.

"PHANNA WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!!!" I screamed.

Phanna quickly turned his gaze towards me in response to my scream.

He looked a bit confused and gave an answer that was just as confusing.

"Uhh... I'm... making art?" Phanna replied.

"Making art? What do you mean by making art? This whole place is going to burn to the ground! Is that art?"

"Uhh... no..."

"Then put that out right now!" I shouted as I ran to the water tube and began pumping it.

It was clear that Phanna had no intention of putting out the fire.

Which is why I took it upon myself to put it out.

But before I could draw any water, Phanna stopped me.

"Melody! Stop!" Phanna said with a bit of panic as he grabbed my arms to stop me.

But I wasn't about to just let Phanna burn everything to ashes.

I activated Strengthen and continued pumping out the water in an act of defiance.

But somewhat confusingly, Phanna didn't activate any Abilities to stop me.

Instead, he simply continued to plea with me.

"Melody! Stop! I'm burning up those wooden skulls. Please! Melody, stop!" Phanna pleaed

But those words mean little to me.

The fire had to be stopped and it looked like I was going to be the one to do it.

"Please! Melody! Think about it! What... what if... what if that cat girl person sees those skulls..." Phanna's voice trailed off at the end of the statement and became increadibly quiet.

And as his words entered my ears, my hands began to slow.

Those skulls... they're the only link between me and the dead Me...

And Phanna was burning them up...

"I had originally wanted to burn them up slowy over time in the fireplace but right now, things have changed... the washroom is the safest place to burn stuff like this since there's a fireplace right under this barrel and there's a water source right beside it." Phanna explained.

He was right...

Looking at the barrel. The entire area around it was stone.

Even the floor in here was stone.

As the fire burned on, I couldn't help but wonder.

"Phanna... why are you doing all this for me..."

"Because I see a part of myself in you?"

"No! That can't be it! There's no way you'd do this much for me. We barely know each other and yet you're basically treating me much better than anyone ever has. Even though I screwed up so many times already, not once have you ever scolded me. Why? Why do you seem to treat me as more than family? Why are you doing everything you're doing... Why... are you treating me... better than my own... family..."

Instead of an answer to any of my questions, Panna rubbed me on my head and instead asked me a question in return.

"Is it wrong of me to try to take care of the person I accidentally killed?"

Phanna's words left me speechless.

How was I supposed to respond to that?

I didn't even have the words to describe the feeling I felt.

Yet in all this uncertainty, there was something that became abundantly clear: Phanna's reason for taking care of me.

Weather it was a sense of guilt, a sense of duty or maybe a bit of both, somehow, it made me feel more comfortable with how things are now.

"Oh, by the way, the water pump wasn't connected to anything so if you actually pumped any water out, it's just going to splash on the floor and end up not doing anything to the fire." Phanna joked.

Looking at the pump again, I realized once again, he was right.

Turning bright red, I quickly dashed back into my room, slammed the door and snuggled one of the slime blobs for the rest of the day.

...

"Hello, allow me to formally introduce myself. I'm Master Emma from Starfall. I'm tasked with investigating the Feburary 32nd incident." introduced the cat lady that came looking for Mikay earlier.

"Hello, and welcome. I am Master Mikay as you probably are already aware of." Answered Mikay.

Mikay then turned towards us and continued.

"The half elf here is my apprentice Phanna. They're more than a little messed up in the head so please excuse the strange things they might end up doing or saying..."

But before Mikay could finish, Phanna interjected immediately.

"Look pal, from my perspective, all of you are a little messed up in the head. But you don't see me saying that to anyone else do you?!"

"As you can see..." Mikay calmly continued.

"Ah... I see..." Emma in an unimpressed tone before turning to me and asking "and you?"

"I-I'm Melody. I'm also one of Master Mikay's a-apprentice." I answered meekly.

It didn't take a genius to figure out that I was the most out of place person in this room.

Mikay and Emma were both Masters. 

Phanna was a strange and exotic being with knowledge that somehow borders on impossiable.

And then, there's me, a nobody.

Just living with Mikay and Phanna alone would have been extremely intimidating if it wasn't for the fact that Phanna acts like a complete lunatic and Mikay's lax attatude in general; likely because of Phanna's presence.

But that lax Mikay I was so used to was nowhere to bee seen and on top of that, another Master has showned up.

I could only find comfort in the farmiliarity of the aloof Phanna that was causing so Mikay so much headache on the regular.

"I see. You don't look like one of the elves from the northern mountains are you not from around here" Emma asked.

"I... Uhh..."

"I summoned both Phanna and Melody." Mikay then answered.

"Ah is that so? Congratulations on two successful summons then." Emma responded with a bit of surprise before continueing on to ask, "Would you be able to tell me what you summoned the two of them for?"

"Unfortunately, that is related to private matters I am uncomfortable about sharing."

"I see. I'll try not to pry futher unless it becomes related to the incident."

"Thank you."

After Mikay's words, silence took over the room.

I'm sure I wasn't the only one feeling the tension between the two Masters as Phanna had been keeping quiet too.

I fully expected him to have said something by now but instead, he did nothing of sort.

This must be some very important meeting if even Phanna is acting strangely out of character even if he looks just as aloof as he normally does.

Taking a deep breath, Emma broke the short silence and took control of the conversation again.

"Mikay, since I'm the investigator of the incident and you were one of the Masters on site that day, I natrually have quite a few questions for you. Can I expect your full cooperation on providing me with answers to my questions?"

"Yes."

"Thank you. Now lets get started. I have a couple of questions to ask you. Fortunately, I already got majority of what I need to know from Master Ethan so I only have a few questions for you. First off, lets go over what we already know so far and if anything seems off, please let me know."

"Right." Mikay noded.

"Right, to start, the incident happened on Feburary 32nd, the day of tht Mastery League's entrence exams. correct?"

"That is correct."

"It incident happened during the 7th round of the exams where one of the prospective students named Melody was killed."

Mikay gave Emma a slow nod.

"It was during the 7th round that a band of unidentified raiders attacked Mountainpass. Based on what we know so far, it just so happened that they were apporaching from a direction that had the Mastery League building as the first building they'd encounter." Emma said with a somewhat intimidating but also serious looking face.

Wait, this wasn't what I remembered, yet Mikay only gave Emma a slow nod just like before.

I quickly glanced at Phanna to see if he had anything to say but he was also keeping silent and only looked on with what can only be described as a serious but emotionless look. 

Maybe this actually happened in this version of the world?

Swallowed my feelings of uncertainty and continued listening.

"During the attack, you, who happen to be on site as a special guest to the exams, and various other staff members of the Mastery League engaged the attackers and managed to drive them back. However many of the others on site were knocked out during the commotion for various reasons but it seemed that the attack was repelled somehow and it is believed that you were present as you are the only combat oriented Master in the Mountainpass area."
