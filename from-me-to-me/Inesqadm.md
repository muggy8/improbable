# Investigator

"We don't want any part in whatever religion you're trying to promote" Phanna said sternly into the small gap between the door and the door frame of the barely opened door.

"Um what" came an unfamiliar voice from the other side of the door before Phanna quickly closed the door.

The person on the other side knocked again and reluctantly, Phanna opened the door only enough to peak out again.

"We also don't what whatever you're trying to sell." Phanna said again then once again closed the door again.

"What are you doing?" I asked.

"Turing away someone who's probably a religious fanatic or a snake oil salesmen."

"Eh... what?"

For the third time, the person out side knocked on the door and this time, she also said something along side the knocking.

"Um? Can I speak with Master Mikay?" the person outside asked.

This time, I was the one to open the door and answer.

"Uh, sorry but Master Mikay is not home at the moment" I said looking at the unexpected guest.

The person standing before me was a female Warecat.

She had long shiny silver white hair that mostly cover her left eye. 

Her cat like ears on top of her head where fully exposed and didn't seem to blend into her hair unlike Phanna's fox like ears.

She was wearing light armor like the set I normally would be wearing had I still been living with the elves but instead of just leather, her armor was plated with bones and seems to fit her very well.

She even had turtle shells as knee and elbow guards. 

"Oh, is that so... Do you happen to know when he might be back" she asked.

"Unfortunately, I don't." I answered.

"I see. I'll try back tomorrow"

"He likely won't be here tomorrow either" Phanna interjected.

"What? Why's that?" the cat lady asked.

"He got suckered into being a 'private instructor' for some elves and today happens to be his first day on the job. We don't know when he'll be back but he likely won't be home all that often from now on." Phanna answered.

"I don't think 'suckered' is the best way to put it..." I argued

"But it's not wrong either right?" Phanna said smugly in the tone he often uses when speaking to Mikay.

The cat lady seeing our exchange chuckled before she spoke again.

"I see. Would you mind if I stayed here and wait for his return?"

"Huh? Why?" Phanna asked.

"I'm here from Starfall to investigate the incident during the Mastery League's entrance exam here in Mountainpass on Feburary 18th."

At her declaration, I froze up as if I was looking at a cold hearted killer.

Despite knowing that I now looked nothing like the Melody who died, I couldn't shake the feeling that she was here to expose me for who I am.

But, I am Melody.

I'm supposed to be dead in this world.

What if she finds out?

But there's no way the cat lady could make the connection right?

"Sure, feel free to wait wherever you like outside" Phanna answered before closing the door.

"What?!" was all the cat lady managed to say before the door closed.

"Um... are you sure that what you did was a good idea?" I asked still a bit shaken.

"Sure it is. We don't need another person to fight for Pillow and Cushion." Phanna joked.

Again, I couldn't tell if Phanna was serious or not.

He dragged me to my room and placed Pillow and Cushion into my arms and dashed off to somewhere else.

"W-what are you doing?" I asked.

"I have to do some cleaning up. You play with Pillow and Cushion." Phanna answered.

After that, I was alone with just my thoughts and 2 adorable blobs bouncing around me.

Judging by her bone plated light armor, she must be either very powerful or not every important.

Most important people in the elven colony wear full body armor when conducting field duties. 

The only exception are the Masters and Grandmasters since armor only slow them down so they end up wearing light armor again sometimes.

No no, I can't apply elven logic to other humanoid races...

Phanna is an example of that.

Nothing I know or think is normal applies to him and he's half elf.

Other races who have nothing in common with elves will are likely even more different.

At that moment, the scent of something burning assaulted my nose.

Fire!!!

My mind immediately went into panic mode.

This is bad.

If there's a fire somewhere, it's going to spread and consume everything.

EVERYTHING! 

The mountain, my party, the colony, everything!

I have to stop it!

I quickly swung my door open only to immediately catch sight of the source of the burning scent.

Phanna was staring into the bathing barrel that was full of fire within the washroom.

"PHANNA WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!!!" I screamed.

Phanna quickly turned his gaze towards me in response to my scream.

He looked a bit confused and gave an answer that was just as confusing.

"Uhh... I'm... making art?" Phanna replied.

"Making art? What do you mean by making art? This whole place is going to burn to the ground! Is that art?"

"Uhh... no..."

"Then put that out right now!" I shouted as I ran to the water tube and began pumping it.

It was clear that Phanna had no intention of putting out the fire.

Which is why I took it upon myself to put it out.

But before I could draw any water, Phanna stopped me.

"Melody! Stop!" Phanna said with a bit of panic as he grabbed my arms to stop me.

But I wasn't about to just let Phanna burn everything to ashes.

I activated Strengthen and continued pumping out the water in an act of defiance.

But somewhat confusingly, Phanna didn't activate any Abilities to stop me.

Instead, he simply continued to plea with me.

"Melody! Stop! I'm burning up those wooden skulls. Please! Melody, stop!" Phanna pleaed

But those words mean little to me.

The fire had to be stopped and it looked like I was going to be the one to do it.

"Please! Melody! Think about it! What... what if... what if that cat girl person sees those skulls..." Phanna's voice trailed off at the end of the statement and became incredibly quiet.

And as his words entered my ears, my hands began to slow.

Those skulls... they're the only link between me and the dead Me...

And Phanna was burning them up...

"I had originally wanted to burn them up slowly over time in the fireplace but right now, things have changed... the washroom is the safest place to burn stuff like this since there's a fireplace right under this barrel and there's a water source right beside it." Phanna explained.

He was right...

Looking at the barrel. The entire area around it was stone.

Even the floor in here was stone.

As the fire burned on, I couldn't help but wonder.

"Phanna... why are you doing all this for me..."

"Because I see a part of myself in you?"

"No! That can't be it! There's no way you'd do this much for me. We barely know each other and yet you're basically treating me much better than anyone ever has. Even though I screwed up so many times already, not once have you ever scolded me. Why? Why do you seem to treat me as more than family? Why are you doing everything you're doing... Why... are you treating me... better than my own... family..."

Instead of an answer to any of my questions, Panna rubbed me on my head and asked me a question in return.

"Is it wrong of me to try to take care of the person I accidentally killed?"

Phanna's words left me speechless.

How was I supposed to respond to that?

I didn't even have the words to describe the feeling I felt.

Yet in all this uncertainty, there was something that became abundantly clear: Phanna's reason for taking care of me.

Weather it was a sense of guilt, a sense of duty or maybe a bit of both, somehow, it made me feel more comfortable with how things are now.

"Oh, by the way, the water pump wasn't connected to anything so if you actually pumped any water out, it's just going to splash on the floor and end up not doing anything to the fire." Phanna joked.

Looking at the pump again, I realized once again, he was right.

Turning bright red, I quickly dashed back into my room, slammed the door and snuggled one of the slime blobs for the rest of the day.

...

"Hello, allow me to formally introduce myself. I'm Master Emma from Starfall. I'm tasked with investigating the Feburary 18th incident." introduced the cat lady that came looking for Mikay earlier.

"Hello, and welcome. I am Master Mikay as you probably are already aware of." Answered Mikay.

Mikay then turned towards us and continued.

"The half elf here is my apprentice Phanna. They're more than a little messed up in the head so please excuse the strange things they might end up doing or saying..."

But before Mikay could finish, Phanna interjected immediately.

"Look pal, from my perspective, all of you are a little messed up in the head. But you don't see me saying that to anyone else do you?!"

"As you can see..." Mikay calmly continued.

"Ah... I see..." Emma in an unimpressed tone before turning to me and asking "and you?"

"I-I'm Melody. I'm also one of Master Mikay's a-apprentice." I answered meekly.

It didn't take a genius to figure out that I was the most out of place person in this room.

Mikay and Emma were both Masters. 

Phanna was a strange and exotic being with knowledge that somehow made the impossible possible.

And then, there's me, a nobody.

Just living with Mikay and Phanna alone would have been extremely intimidating if it wasn't for the fact that Phanna acts like a complete lunatic and Mikay's lax attitude in general; likely because of Phanna's presence.

But that lax Mikay I was so used to was nowhere to be seen and on top of that, another Master has shown up.

I could only find comfort in the familiarity of the aloof Phanna that was causing so Mikay so much headache on the regular.

"I see. You don't look like one of the elves from the northern mountains are you not from around here" Emma asked.

"I... Uhh..."

"I summoned both Phanna and Melody." Mikay then answered.

"Ah is that so? Congratulations on two successful summons then." Emma responded with a bit of surprise before continuing on to ask, "Would you be able to tell me what you summoned the two of them for?"

"Unfortunately, that is related to private matters I am uncomfortable about sharing."

"I see. I'll try not to pry further unless it becomes related to the incident."

"Thank you."

After Mikay's words, silence took over the room.

I'm sure I wasn't the only one feeling the tension between the two Masters as Phanna had been keeping quiet too.

I fully expected him to have said something by now but instead, he did nothing of sort.

This must be some very important meeting if even Phanna is acting strangely out of character even if he looks just as aloof as he normally does.

Taking a deep breath, Emma broke the short silence and took control of the conversation again.

"Mikay, since I'm the investigator of the incident and you were one of the Masters on site that day, I naturally have quite a few questions for you. Can I expect your full cooperation on providing me with answers to my questions?"

"Yes."

"Thank you. Now lets get started. Fortunately, I already got majority of what I need to know from Master Ethan so I only have a few questions for you. First off, lets go over what we already know so far and if anything seems off, please let me know."

"Right." Mikay noded.

"To start, the incident happened on Feburary 18th, the day of the Mastery League's entrance exams. correct?"

"That is correct."

"It incident happened during the 7th round of the exams where one of the prospective students named Melody was killed."

Mikay gave Emma a slow nod.

"It was during the 7th round that a band of unidentified raiders attacked Mountainpass. Based on what we know so far, it just so happened that they were attacking from a direction that placed the Mastery League building as the first building they'd encounter." Emma said with a somewhat intimidating but also serious looking face.

Wait, this wasn't what I remembered, yet Mikay only gave Emma a slow nod just like before.

I quickly glanced at Phanna to see if he had anything to say but he was also keeping silent and only looked on with what can only be described as a serious but emotionless look. 

Maybe this actually happened in this version of the world?

I swallowed my feelings of uncertainty and continued listening.

"During the attack, you, who happen to be on site as a special guest to the exams, and various other staff members of the Mastery League engaged the attackers and managed to drive them back. However many of the others on site were knocked out during the attack. The attack unfortunately claimed the life of a prospective student named Melody. However, the attack was repelled somehow and it is believed that you were the one who managed it as you are the only combat oriented Master in the Mountainpass area. This so far seems correct to you Master Mikay?"

Again, Mikay responded with a slow nod as before while Phanna remained silent as well.

But this completely went against everything I knew and everything I was told, even by Phanna.

In the history of this world, I was killed by Phanna during my attempt on his life because I triggered his 'self defense mode' and died because of it.

As I was about to voice this, I suddenly remembered something else that Mikay had told me.

Everyone else's memory of the events had been altered and it made it seem like my death in the world was an accident caused by some other unknown group instead.

With that thought now in my mind, it became clear what Emma what trying to do and why Mikay was just nodding along and why Phanna seemed to remain silent this whole time.

Emma wasn't trying to confirm anything here, instead, she's just trying to tell us what we're supposed to know instead of what we actually know.

"After this, based on communication records, we know that you had contacted the Mastery League headquarters after this incident. However, for some reason, the communication stopped abruptly half way through. It is this sudden stopping of communication that I'm mainly here to speak to you about as you are the only one who was present at the time."

"I see." Mikay responded with yet another slow nod.

"Master Mikay, I would like to ask you to explain to the best of your ability what happened during the communication and how the communication ended from your perspective."

After hearing Emma's question, Mikay closed his eyes and took a deep breath before sighing and falling into silence. 

With all 4 of us in silence once again, the tension within this room somehow became even thicker.

Seconds felt like minutes, minutes felt like hours.

I quickly lost track of time somehow under the heavy atmosphere.

Please, somebody, anybody, say something...

Phanna, why did you choose now of all time to become a completely different person?

Where's your strange and incomprehensible statements in this situation?

This tense atmosphere is suffocating me!!

But just as I had thought this, Mikay suddenly spoke up.

"During the communication with headquarters, some of the people who fell unconscious due to the attack were starting to regain consciousness again. Seeing this, I quickly went to their aid and accidentally dropped the communicator in doing so."

After this statement by Mikay, the room once again fell into silence.

This time, Emma was the one who seemed to be lost in thought.

Phanna looked completely unfazed and remained completely silent just as before.

Was I the only one feeling this uneasy right now?

Maybe that just shows how insignificant I was in the face of all of these extremely powerful people.

Just like before, the silence this time did not last either.

This time, Emma was the one to break the silence.

"Is that so? Tending to the injured is a very important duty despite the fact that, as a combat oriented Master, you are not entirely qualified to do so. Even so, I must still commend you for the efforts. That said, based on what we know so far, Master Ethan, who was a healing oriented Master, was the first to regain..."

"No. I was the first to regain consciousness." interjected Phanna cutting into Emma's speech.

"I'm sorry, Please ignore Phanna" Mikay insisted but Phanna didn't relent.

"I was the first to wake up and Mikay here seemed to be beside me by the time I was fully conscious. I ended up having an argument with him for a while before I ran away from him and left him at the school grounds."

Phanna's comment seemed to have struck something within Emma as she eyed him suspiciously.

Why does Phanna seem to choose the worst possible time to break his silence and return to his usual self.

Yet despite feeling this way, part of me was glad to just have the normal Phanna back.

"That's an interesting proposition there... Phanna"

"Does what I say not sound correct to you? That is to say, are you suggesting that you know the order of who regained consciousness and when?" Phanna accused.

"Phanna please stop!" Mikay plead but to no success.

Despite the strange words of accusation from Phanna, Emma appeared to be the one driven into a corner.

"I suppose what you're saying isn't entirely impossible..." Emma sighed before she leaned back into her chair and getting a bit lost in thought.

Once again, silence befell the room but this time, it was quickly broken again as Emma quickly spoke up once more.

"Phanna, I believe I must now also question you. Would you be willing to cooperate?" Emma asked glaring at Phanna.

Phanna, for his part, was still somehow completely unfazed and responded with a casual "Sure".

"Tell me in the best way you can, what you were doing starting from the start of round 7 up to when you left Master Mikay after your argument." Emma asked.

Despite the question not directed at me, something about Emma and her words triggered a deep and unsettling fear within me.

Yet somehow, both Mikay and Phanna seemed unaffected.

Without skipping a beat, Phanna began answering Emma's question in a way that felt all too unfitting for the situation at hand.

"My round 7 opponent happened to be the Melody that died on that day. We had a somewhat confusing chat about our past, present and future that lasted a bit longer than it probably should. After that, as we got ready to fight, the attack from the unknown entities came. Melody was killed in the chaos while I was knocked out. After I had woken up, Mikay was next to me trying to tend to me though I didn't really need it. I ended up arguing with Mikay about the situation we now found ourselves in. Because of that, I decided that I needed some alone time and ran off to hide from Mikay. Fortunately, Mikay, decided to stay behind instead of pursuing me."

After Phanna finished his explanation, I quickly glanced at Mikay before returning my gaze to Emma.

Mikay looked somewhat surprised by Phanna's answer but it was hard to tell what he was thinking exactly. 

Emma, on the other hand, seemed rather pained by what Phanna had said and had her arms crossed as she mulled over Phanna's statements.

Before long, Emma unfolded her hands and gave a nodding sigh to Phanna and stood up saying:

"I think I have the whole picture here. Very well. I shall take my leave now."

"I bid you farewell then, Master Emma." Mikay said in response to Emma's declaration.

"You too Master Mikay." Emma responded back.

After that, Mikay showed Emma to the door and closed it after waving goodbye to her.

The room was once again filled with silence as Mikay returned to the desk we were all sitting at. 

Although we had one less highly important person among us and I was once again with my strangely familiar group of housemates, the uneasy atmosphere did not disperse.

The 3 of us sat in silence and once again, time began to lose meaning.

"Thanks" Mikay spoke barely under his breath.

Yet despite the soft tone, his words rung loud and clear in my ears.

"Glad you noticed" Phanna answered back. 

And then, there was me...

"Um... What just happened?"
