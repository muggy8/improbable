# WIP

I've been heading over to Amanda's village to provide them with suplimentary lessons for almost a month now.

All of the elves on guard duty more or less regonize me and would stop harassing me each time I show up.

Infact many of them welcomed me when I came at this point.

I've been told that elves were gererally quite territorial so being able to come and go freely from any elf occupied territory is something not many can claim without being an elf themselves.

That said, I'm still rather cautious about my surroundings here since I really can't forget the strange sequence of events that lead me to were I am today.

That said, even despite that, I've been catching myself off guard more often than I'd like these days.

I'm not sure if the elves here have realized that or not but I'm sure that sooner or later, something will happen. 

Will I be ready for it when that happens?

These are the thoughts I had as I watched the group of elves infront of me practicing using Observation.

Behind me was a rock I had shaped into a zigzag.

The student's jobs were to feel around me with their Sphere of influence to determine how many twists I had placed into the zigzag stick.

This was a method that I remember my teacher tenching me with that seemed to help me a lot and I also used to teach Hickory.

Though the method seemed to work fine with these students, Melody was somehow a different story.

I tried everything I could think of to help her improve her control over her Sphere of Influence but nothing seemed to work.

I wonder if Phanna will be easier to teach...

Assuming that Phanna is able to obtain a Sphere of Influence...

No stop... I can't let my mind go wondering off like that...

I'm in the middle of enemy territory with no real backup or support.

If they catch me off guard, that could be desasterous.

"6" the elf girl infront of me said finally after focusing all of her strength on feeling around with her Sphere of Influence.

I then stepped asside to reveal the zigzag rock stick behind me.

It clearly had 6 zigzags bent into it.

"Grats" I said as I handed the girl the rock and began forming anther one behind me with Forgemaster as I called out to the next one in line.

...

By the time I had returned home, Phanna was  awake already as expected and they were fighting over Pillow and Cushen.

I could tell that much just by the noises that was coming from Phanna's room.

"Stop this right now!" I shouted as I slamed open the door to Phanna's room.

Immediately after I entered, both Phanna and Melody dropped the slimes that were in their hands and looked towards me.

"Um... welcome home?" Phanna said.

"I've told you two to stop messing with Pillow and Cushen! They're both clearly not happy about being toys for you two!" I scolded as I picked up my pets from the floor and dropped them back into the aquarium.

Phanna and Melody has been around for so long that Pillow and Cushen no longer seem to get agitated in their presence.

Instead, the two slimes seem to want nothing to do with Phanna and Melody.

I chewed into Phanna and Melody some more but I let up after a while.

I'm sure no matter how much I scold them now, they'll still be doing this again tomorrow.

I let out a sigh as I closed Phanna's door and headed off to cook dinner for me and Melody.

Phanna no longer eats with us anymore after that one incident which made dinner preperations easier.

Melody even helps by doing the hunting while I'm away too which helps out a lot.

sometimes, she'd go and do some foraging and gather fruits, vegietables and mushrooms too.

Unfortunately, today's not one of those days as all we're eating for dinner is some roasted meat.

"Melody, dinner's ready." I called out after I finish roasting the meat.

At my call she quickly came out to have dinner.

As we sat there eating food, I was reminded of the simple days I spent with Aurora and Hickory.

As a family, we lived day to day not knowing what would come next but enjoying the moments we had at the time.

Sharing meals were one of those times and hunting or foraging was another.

We ate what we could get our hands on but we were happy just to have each other.

Sitting here with Melody reminded me of those days as we at our food. 

The only thing that felt missing was the idle chatter that we normally had over dinner between me, Aurora and Hickory.

"I need to eat some rocks!" Phanna said suddenly as they sat down beside Melody and I.

"Uhh What!?" Melody studdered.

"Go right ahead" I answered uncaringly.

Lately, I've mostly gotten used to Phanna's incomprehenseable statements and outbusts.

I've even managed to completely ignore these strange statements now and not be bothered at all by them.

Melody, on the other hand, still gets dragged around for a loop by Phanna each time one of these these nonsensical outbusts are made.

"Why would you want to eat rocks?" Melody asked.

"I need a fair bit of Silicon and a bit of Iron to finish the project I'm working on."

"Um... What's Silicon?" Melody asked.

"It's.... uhh, one of the elements..."

"But you never even fully explained what an 'element' even is..." 

As Phanna struggles to give Melody a satisfactory answer, I picked up my food tray and went over to the kitchen to clean it.

This has become a somewhat common everyday occurance now.

Phanna would spout some nonsense to catch Melody's attention and she'd take the bait and get pulled along.

For whatever reason, Phanna seems to enjoy teasing Melody this way.

Though I can't really complain as it keeps things lively around here.

"Why not go outside and eat some rock off the ground if you want to eat them so badly" I said as I finished cleaning my food tray.

Ofcourse, my statement interupted something Phanna was explaining but I had no idea what it was.

I was never listening to begin with. 

Phanna's full of these strange ideas and concepts that it's best for me to not engage with them.

Afterall, the stupid ideas just goes deeper and deeper and there's no end to them.

"You know, I can't just eat any rocks right? I need a specal type of rock with a high surface area to volume..."

"Sure sure, go find your special rock then."

"That's the issue! I have no idea where to go to find them!" Phanna pouted. 

"Where are they normally found then?" Melody asked.

"Well... anywhere really. We're probably standing on some right now but we'd have to dig for quite a while before we hit some..."

"I'll be in my room if you need me." I sighed as I left Phanna and Melody to continue on their usual meaningless discussions.

...

The next morning, I was greeted by the most unusual of sights as I left my room.

Phanna was sitting by the living room table tormenting Pillow and Cushen.

"Morning"

"Arn't you normally asleep right now?"

"Only sometimes. But I would normally be in bed by now."

"So why aren't you in bed right now?"

"Because I want you to take me to the elven mountains."

"Eh? Why's that?" I said feeling a bit irritated.

"To look for my special rock. Duh!" 

"Oh, good morning Mikay and Phanna" Melody said walking up behind me.

It seems all 3 of us are awake now.
