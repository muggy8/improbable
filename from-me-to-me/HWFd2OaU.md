# WIP

I've been heading over to Amanda's village to provide them with suplimentary lessons for almost a month now.

All of the elves on guard duty more or less regonize me and would stop harassing me each time I show up.

Infact many of them welcomed me when I came at this point.

I've been told that elves were gererally quite territorial so being able to come and go freely from any elf occupied territory is something not many can claim without being an elf themselves.

That said, I'm still rather cautious about my surroundings here since I really can't forget the strange sequence of events that lead me to were I am today.

That said, even despite that, I've been catching myself off guard more often than I'd like these days.

I'm not sure if the elves here have realized that or not but I'm sure that sooner or later, something will happen. 

Will I be ready for it when that happens?

These are the thoughts I had as I watched the group of elves infront of me practicing using Observation.

Behind me was a rock I had shaped into a zigzag.

The student's jobs were to feel around me with their Sphere of influence to determine how many twists I had placed into the zigzag stick.

This was a method that I remember my teacher tenching me with that seemed to help me a lot and I also used to teach Hickory.

Though the method seemed to work fine with these students, Melody was somehow a different story.

I tried everything I could think of to help her improve her control over her Sphere of Influence but nothing seemed to work.

I wonder if Phanna will be easier to teach...

Assuming that Phanna is able to obtain a Sphere of Influence...

No stop... I can't let my mind go wondering off like that...

I'm in the middle of enemy territory with no real backup or support.

If they catch me off guard, that could be desasterous.

"6" the elf girl infront of me said finally after focusing all of her strength on feeling around with her Sphere of Influence.

I then stepped asside to reveal the zigzag rock stick behind me.

It clearly had 6 zigzags bent into it.

"Grats" I said as I handed the girl the rock and began forming anther one behind me with Forgemaster as I called out to the next one in line.

...

By the time I had returned home, Phanna was  awake already as expected and they were fighting over Pillow and Cushen.

I could tell that much just by the noises that was coming from Phanna's room.

"Stop this right now!" I shouted as I slamed open the door to Phanna's room.

Immediately after I entered, both Phanna and Melody dropped the slimes that were in their hands and looked towards me.

"Um... welcome home?" Phanna said.

"I've told you two to stop messing with Pillow and Cushen! They're both clearly not happy about being toys for you two!" I scolded as I picked up my pets from the floor and dropped them back into the aquarium.

Phanna and Melody has been around for so long that Pillow and Cushen no longer seem to get agitated in their presence.

Instead, the two slimes seem to want nothing to do with Phanna and Melody.

I chewed into Phanna and Melody some more but I let up after a while.

I'm sure no matter how much I scold them now, they'll still be doing this again tomorrow.

I let out a sigh as I closed Phanna's door and headed off to cook dinner for me and Melody.

Phanna no longer eats with us anymore after that one incident which made dinner preperations easier.

Melody even helps by doing the hunting while I'm away too which helps out a lot.

sometimes, she'd go and do some foraging and gather fruits, vegietables and mushrooms too.

Unfortunately, today's not one of those days as all we're eating for dinner is some roasted meat.

"Melody, dinner's ready." I called out after I finish roasting the meat.

At my call she quickly came out to have dinner.

As we sat there eating food, I was reminded of the simple days I spent with Aurora and Hickory.

As a family, we lived day to day not knowing what would come next but enjoying the moments we had at the time.

Sharing meals were one of those times and hunting or foraging was another.

We ate what we could get our hands on but we were happy just to have each other.

Sitting here with Melody reminded me of those days as we at our food. 

The only thing that felt missing was the idle chatter that we normally had over dinner between me, Aurora and Hickory.

"I need to eat some rocks!" Phanna said suddenly as they sat down beside Melody and I.

"Uhh What!?" Melody studdered.

"Go right ahead" I answered uncaringly.

Lately, I've mostly gotten used to Phanna's incomprehenseable statements and outbusts.

I've even managed to completely ignore these strange statements now and not be bothered at all by them.

Melody, on the other hand, still gets dragged around for a loop by Phanna each time one of these these nonsensical outbusts are made.

"Why would you want to eat rocks?" Melody asked.

"I need a fair bit of Silicon and a bit of Iron to finish the project I'm working on."

"Um... What's Silicon?" Melody asked.

"It's.... uhh, one of the elements..."

"But you never even fully explained what an 'element' even is..." 

As Phanna struggles to give Melody a satisfactory answer, I picked up my food tray and went over to the kitchen to clean it.

This has become a somewhat common everyday occurance now.

Phanna would spout some nonsense to catch Melody's attention and she'd take the bait and get pulled along.

For whatever reason, Phanna seems to enjoy teasing Melody this way.

Though I can't really complain as it keeps things lively around here.

"Why not go outside and eat some rock off the ground if you want to eat them so badly" I said as I finished cleaning my food tray.

Ofcourse, my statement interupted something Phanna was explaining but I had no idea what it was.

I was never listening to begin with. 

Phanna's full of these strange ideas and concepts that it's best for me to not engage with them.

Afterall, the stupid ideas just goes deeper and deeper and there's no end to them.

"You know, I can't just eat any rocks right? I need a specal type of rock with a high surface area to volume..."

"Sure sure, go find your special rock then."

"That's the issue! I have no idea where to go to find them!" Phanna pouted. 

"Where are they normally found then?" Melody asked.

"Well... anywhere really. We're probably standing on some right now but we'd have to dig for quite a while before we hit some..."

"I'll be in my room if you need me." I sighed as I left Phanna and Melody to continue on their usual meaningless discussions.

...

The next morning, I was greeted by the most unusual of sights as I left my room.

Phanna was sitting by the living room table tormenting Pillow and Cushen.

"Morning"

"Arn't you normally asleep right now?"

"Only sometimes. But I would normally be in bed by now."

"So why aren't you in bed right now?"

"Because I want you to take me to the elven mountains."

"Eh? Why's that?" I said feeling a bit irritated.

"To look for my special rock. Duh!" 

"Oh, good morning Mikay and Phanna" Melody said walking up behind me.

It seems all 3 of us are awake now.

What a rare sight...

"So, Melody there told me last night that she used to live in the mountain. After thinking about its likely that I'll be able to find the specail rock that I'm looking for near the surface on a mountain. Since you're tutoring them, it'd make paying the mountains a visit easier for me"

"Are you serious?" I lemented.

"I mean, you did mention to Amanda that you'd bring guests." Phanna pressed.

"I did that because I was thinking I'd tutor other students if the school remains closed next semester too since it's really my fault they had to close for a while."

"Well what's the harm in bringing me now? Besides, it's probably close to when they'll try to do something to you by now. Nothing has happened so far and they likely wouldn't be putting in so much effort into getting you td visit every day if they weren't planning something."

"And how would you help if that was the case?" I pressed.

"Having someone new and unfarmiliar around would definately throw off their plans whatever they are right? Just that should be enough to keep you safe for another couple of weeks. Then I'll tag out with Melody here... or not since she still needs her bones to heal first... maybe we can both go? hmm..."

Phanna suddenly dipped into thought part way through explaining their plan.

Honestly, I don't know if I should be impressed that Phanna thinks things through this much or annoyed that Phanna doesn't do anything useful despite it.

At this point, I don't even know if I should bother with waiting for Phanna to even put in any effort in trying to save my daughter.

But Phanna does make a pretty valid case.

I've gotten too used to the elves at this point that I'm no longer as sharp as I used to be.

That said, I also haven't noticed the elves doing anything that could be considered as nafarious.

But considering how forceful they were about getting me to visit their territory, it seems unlikely that they have nothing else planned.

As much as I hate to admit it, Phanna's completely right in their assessment.

If they were trying something, now would be the perfect time and having Phanna with me would definately throw their plans off by some amount.

"If you want to come, then come. But don't expect me to take care of you however." I said as I went over to the fireplace to prepair breakfast.

"Oh. sweet! Melody, take care of Pillow and Cushen!" Phanna exclaimed tossing the two slimes over to Melody.

"PHANNA! Don't go tossing my pets around like some toy!!" I yelled upon seeing this.

But my scolding fell on deaf ears as Phanna gave me a playful gesture, took a food tray and ran out the front door.

As soon as the door closed, I could hear some footsteps on the roof; clearly, Phanna's gathering some of those strange black grass they decided to grow on the roof as food.

...

The two of us arrived at the elven training grounds later in the day.

On our way to the training grounds, many of the elves  who would normally guard the area came to check out Phanna.

Quite a few of them even tried to strike up conversations.

Of course, I completely ignored everything and anything that came out of Phanna's mouth for my own good and hence didn't catch much of what happened.

"What are you going to do now?" I asked Phanna after we arrived at the training grounds.

"You said you were looking for some special type of rocks or something but I cant exactly follow you around. I'll be staying here for the rest of the day to teach the elves here." I explained furher.

"Hmm... I think i'm going to explore the region a bit. Mybe I'll find what I need." Phanna answered.

Phanna's answer shocked me a bit inside.

I didn't expect Phanna to be able to give an type of answer or explanation that actually made sense.

But I guess anything is possiable.

At that time, another elf came up to us looking for a chat.

"Teacher, who's this" the elf asked clearly gesturing towards Phanna.

"This is Phanna, my apprentice of sorts" I answered.

"Sup" Phanna added playfully.

"Phann... hmm... Are you pregnent?" asked the elf girl.

"What" I spat.

Phanna, on the other hand, doesn't seem too bothered and answered calmly.

"Nah. I can't get pregent."

"Then what's with the stomach bulge" the elf girl pressed.

"Oh, im building an electron scattering microscoope" Phanna answered as if either of us had any idea of what that is.

I, for my part, ignored it and just move on with checking my surroundings but the elf girl who's name escapes me, is not so lucky and got pulled into one of Phanna's strange rants.

Pretty soon, the elf girl was eyeing me in a way that was pretty much saying "please help get me out of this."

Of course, being me, I completely ignored it.

I definately didn't want to get involved with any of Phanna's strange ideas. 

Additionally, this was something you bestowed upon yourself. 

I'm not going to get my brain damaged to save you from whatever it is that you got yourself into.

That said, what the elf girl said did strike me as somewhat odd.

She said something about Phanna being pregenent and from the outside, it does look like Phanna has a small bulge on their stomach.

However, I know that that cant be the case.

Afterall, Eathan cant find Phanna's repordutive organs and he's an expert at that. 

Not only that, Phanna themselves even admited to  not having anything so I'm sure Phanna can't be pregenent.

That said, it sure does look like Phanna's pregnent from the outside doesn't it?

Shaking this thought from my mind, I turned towards my students and proceeded on with the rest of my day.
