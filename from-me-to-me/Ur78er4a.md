# Home Once More

"You should come with us today too." Phanna suggested to me playfully from across the table.

Seeing Phanna awake in the morning 2 days in a row was strange enough as it is already but having Phanna suggest something like this is confusing me even more.

"Um... Uhh..." I shuddered unsure of how to make of the situation.

I instinctively turned towards Mikay for guidance.

"Mikay is that ok with you" I asked

"No, of course not. But Phanna always ends up having their way anyways so there's nothing I can do about it." Mikay sighed.

"Oh um... ok..." I said hesitantly.

I guess I wasn't the only one who doesn't know how to deal with Phanna.

Mikay, it seems, has decided to just let Phanna do as he pleases and Ignore everything he says.

I wouldn't say that that's not a good strategy when it comes to Phanna but there's no way I would be able to do that.

There's just something about Phanna that I can't possibly ignore no matter what absurd things he says after all he'd done for me with the strange knowledge he has.

"So what do you say? Wanna join us today?" Phanna asked again playfully.

Do I want to?

I mean, I am curious about how things are doing back home but going there still made me uneasy.

I'm supposed to be dead right.

And will I be able to face the reality of how everyone else felt about me?

I'm scared to find out.

But what if it's not as bad as I thought it was.

Still feeling unsure, I just ended up asking Phanna a question instead.

"Um... why do you want me coming along?" I asked hesitantly

"Well, Yesterday, the elves in the mountains kinda snagged me and questioned me all day. I was thinking I'd have you entertain the elves today so I can explore the mountains alone."

"You're bringing Melody along for such a stupid reason?!" Mikay blurted out in protest.

"Well, that's not the only reason ok! But it is the main reason."

"Ugh... forget that I asked..." Mikay quickly retracted.

"Um... ok" Phanna answered looking a bit confused.

Now the real question is, how do I feel about this?

I am truly curious about how the colony and my party is doing.

But being used by Phanna this way made me feel a bit dissatisfied.

Then again, it's not like I have anything to live for or anything to lose so I feel like I should be happy to be of use to someone.

I guess I'll just go along with Phanna's whims.

"Um... I guess I was feeling kind of curious how things are doing at home so I'll come along." I answered hesitantly. 

"Sweet, then let's get this meal over with quickly so we can set off as soon as possible."

Immediately after saying that, Phanna quickly finished eating the rest of the strange food he always eats and went outside to dump the left overs into the roof pond.

"Why are you so excited about this?" I asked after Phanna returned.

"Hmm? I'm really close to finishing the assembler I've been working on and all that I'm missing now is a bit of Silicon and Iron. Of course I'd be excited!" Phanna answered with a smile.

...

"Oh my gosh! Your hair is so pretty!"

"Why is your hair so red?!"

"Where are you from? I've never seen anyone like you before! Which colony are you from?"

"Why are you with Master Mikay and Phanna?"

"Are you Phanna's first child?"

"Is Phanna just as crazy at home as she is here?"

"What's Master Mikay like at home? He's gotta be the father right?"

The never ending stream of questions began as soon as we arrived.

Many of the elves around us where ones I've never seen before but some of them I recognized from my party.

Of course, none of them recognized me.

Was it because of how different I looked or was it because I was actively trying to hide my face behind my hair, I didn't know.

But it seems no one here recognizes me.

I guess this is what it must mean to be 'a stranger in your own home'

I recognized so much of the surrounding, the short support trees around me, the tall lookout trees, the hiding bushes, they all are familiar.

Even the clearing in the trees that the proving grounds is located and the various structures around, I knew this place very well.

And the most frightening of all, the other elves that I recognize.

The elves from the other parties is one thing but even the elves from my own party where joining in too.

There weren't many from my party here but there were some.

Amanda and Hannah where the ones that I recognize, and are currently swarming me with the rest of the elves.

Somehow, not being recognized by them made me feel both relieved but also extremely sad.

After all, they were people I lived with every day for almost all of my life and yet here they are, acting like complete strangers in front of me.

What do I do?

How should I react?

Why does this feel so uncomfortable?

But at the same time, a sense of relief was washing over me.

It seems that my sisters were doing fine even after my death.

Just seeing this first hand brought me a sense of relief unlike any I've ever felt before despite the fact that I wasn't ever that important to our party's success.

Maybe there's something special about seeing something with my own eyes that makes it all the more meaningful.

Yet as I thought this, I was faced with another realization, that I was just a nobody and completely worthless to my team.

I was at best just along for the ride and at worse dead weight for the party.

Seeing Amanda and Hanna the way they are right now made that clear as day.

Right now, they should be on patrol with the rest of the party.

But they're here and no one else is, not even Patrisha.

That means the party itself is still actively carrying out normal duties instead of being on break for schooling.

I could understand having one of the party's aces away for schooling being ok but 2?

That only proves how worthless I was.

How much of a burden I was.

How much I didn't deserve any of what I had then... or even now.

Nobody needs me, not then, not now.

Unwanted and unneeded, that's who I am.

That's what I'll always be.

Why am I even here?

"Hey Melody? Are you alright? Why are you crying all of a sudden?" asked an elf standing near by.

When did I start crying?

"Ah... uh..." I choked as I struggled for words.

"Hey now, try to leave Melody alone for a bit. She's probably just not ready for all this attention." Mikay said stepping in to the group of elves surrounding me.

At his command, the elves around me took a couple steps back to give me a bit of space.

"You ok there Melody?" Mikay asked standing next to me.

I couldn't give him an answer.

I could only look down and drown in my own sorrows.

"That Phanna... geez..." Mikay grunted in frustration as he looked around.

I didn't have to follow his gaze to know what he's trying to do. 

Phanna was no where to be seen and Mikay was surely looking for him.

"Anyways, you should probably stay with me for today." Mikay said.

I responded to Mikay's suggestion with a meek nod and tried my best to stay close to him.

Despite him being a master and me being a nobody, his presence next to me somehow felt calming. 

This normally wouldn't have been the case as I recalled the first I met him during the entrance exams.

Things sure have changed since then.

At first, he was like an untouchable being of power and authority

But now, he feels just like a friend, or maybe even family.

Even despite this, I can't help but feel that this is all wrong.

Mikay's kindness is wasted on someone as worthless as me.

I'm nothing but trouble and not worth the effort.

All I'll be in the future is trouble. 

Nothing will ever change.

I've been trying my best for as long as I can remember and I've never amounted to anything.

I've only ever messed things up, let my curiosity get the best of me and caused problems for those around me.

So why me?

I don't deserve this, I don't deserve any of this...

"I'm sorry..."

I'm sorry for being such a burden on everyone...

"I'm sorry..."

I'm sorry for the problems I've caused....

"I'm sorry..."

I'm sorry for the failure that I am.

"I'm sorry..."

I'm sorry for wasting all of everyone's time and energy...

"I'm sor..."

"It's ok Melody... It's ok." Mikay's voice was soft and gentle as he interrupted me.

"I... I..."

"Maybe we should head home for the day..." 

At Mikay's suggestion, I could feel countless cold gazes coming at me from the elves around.

There it is again, I've messed up yet another thing.

If only I wasn't here, if only I didn't exist, things would be so much better without me.

The only thing I'll ever be is worthless, counterproductive, dead weight.

I wish I was never born.

"N-no... please..." I barely managed to choke out.

I don't want it... 

This is the last time I'll be here I'm sure.

I don't want my final memories of home to be of me messing everything up as usual.

But I can't say any of this out loud, so I did the only thing I could.

"P-please continue... I-I'll be fine..." I whimpered.

This was all I could manage to say to Mikay.

He gave me a troubled look before asking:

"Are you sure?"

I gave him a weak nod in response but he didn't seem too convinced by my answer and continued eyeing me.

After a short while, he seemed to have decided on something and sat me down somewhere away form the field in the trees.

"Melody, I'll try to keep today's lesson a quick one. Try and hold yourself together till it's over ok?"

I gave Mikay a weak nod again as he stood back up.

At my answer, Mikay gave my head a quick rub before walking towards the other elves in the field.

For what felt like a couple hours after my morning struggles, nothing much happened.

None of the other elves tried to approach me much and I ended up spending the time watching Mikay practice with his students.

Mikay's lessons mostly boiled down to how to maintain activation of abilities for longer and how to activate more abilities at once, things that I've never managed to do on my own.

The other elves seem to be getting more out of the lessons than I was able to even though I received one on one lessons from Mikay for so long.

I guess that just goes to show how much of a failure I was and still am.

Many of the other elves that were around to watch had also gone back to their duties now and the area around the training grounds became eerily empty.

I was the only one sitting around.

The quiet alone time gave me a bit of comfort as I'd have little to no opportunity to mess anything up.

And that's really all I can be at the point.

The best I can be is something that isn't a burden.

I really am the worst.

As I watched the students getting taught by Mikay one after, I began to notice a somewhat alarming tune echoing in the air.

At first, it was soft and distant and easily mistaken for the wind.

But with each repetition, the tune and melody of the song became clearer and more apparent.

And then, It all came together, the song, the call, it was an emergency assistance request call.

The notes of the song that echoed made it clear: "Urgent. Need help. Region 11. Combat."

I could feel my hair stand on edge as the call echoed past the area.

What does this mean?

I almost jumped up to rush to the area but I stopped myself before I followed through with that idea.

I'll be of no help anyways and I'll probably just cause issues for everyone else.

Not only that, I was supposed to be a random person who's unfamiliar with the mountains much less the elven communication methods used here.

Lastly, Mikay's students didn't seem to have noticed at all.

I'm sure they've heard but they're pretending nothing's wrong.

I'm sure there's a reason for that and I should probably do that too. 

But... But... this is the first time I've ever heard an emergency combat request like this before.

What could have triggered it?

What could be the cause?

It felt like a question I must find the answer to.

But... I'll mess things up if I go won't I...

Maybe I should just stay here...

But... This isn't something that happens every day... and region 11 is really close to the central nest...

What could have possibly gotten so close...

I... I have to find out...

I... I'll just stay far away and watch... that way, there's no chance for me to mess anything up... right?

Yah...!
