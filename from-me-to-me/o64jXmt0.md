# Interlude: Damage Report

A female elf warrior stood before a bed within in a small room deep forests of the elves.

"Status report." asked the person resting in the bed.

"37 confirmed dead, 74 injured with 22 of them sustaining major injuries. The remaining 52 are expected to fully recover." replied the elf warrior.

"That's quite the significant loss it seems."

"Unfortunately so."

"And all this brought on by a single person?"

"Yes..." answered the elf warrior in an unsteady tone.

A short silence fell upon the room but it was quickly broken when the person resting in bed sat up revealing features that could only be described as motherly.

"My queen?" the elf warrior asked in confusion.

The queen looked directly into the eyes of the elf warrior as if to discern something from her.

"You were present at the battle correct?" asked the elf queen.

"Yes! However, I wasn't there at the beginning. I arrived on the scene near the end."

The elf queen thought about this for a moment before returning her attention back to the warrior standing before her.

"Permission for Influence Extension" the elf queen commanded.

The elf warrior was a bit confused at first but quickly responded after her mind caught up with what was happening.

"Granted"

Silence then befell the room as the elf queen closed her eyes and fell into a state of deep thought.

The elf warrior was unsure of what to do so she stood still and waited.

The elf queen, on the other hand, was digging thought he elf warrior's memories reviewing everything she can about the encounter with Phanna.

"hmmm..." the elf queen hummed as her eyes moved beneath her eyelids.

Her expression grim and her body tense.

"Terminate Influence Extension" whispered the elf queen in utter disbelief. 

"It seems that we were lucky..." the elf queen sighed.

"lucky?" asked the warrior.

"Yes... quite lucky..."

The elf warrior was quite confused at the elf queen's assessment and it showed clearly on her face.

The elf queen also clearly realized this and began explaining.

"It's quite fortunate that Mikay interfered. Otherwise, we'd be without a large chunk of our territorial defense force." the elf queen explained.

"Is this Phanna character that strong?" the elf warrior asked.

"I would say she's at lest as strong as Mikay if not more."

At this assessment, a cold sweat ran down the elf warrior's back.

The elf warrior didn't see Phanna as anything special.

No at the time, and not after the fact.

But the elf warrior also knew that she wasn't all that strong herself either.

She had judged that beating Phanna was only a matter of time and sooner or later, Phanna would be exhausted.

That's why she didn't judge Phanna to be too strong.

Yet even despite this judgement, the elf warrior also knew that the elf queen is often correct about many things. 

Many consider the elf queen the apex of wisdom whil others considered her to be the apex of power.

What the elf queen was didn't matter, all the elf warrior knew was that the elf queen's judgement is rarely ever wrong.

That's why the elf warrior was taken aback by her assessment.

This Phanna character was someone who the elf queen deemed to be of equal strength to a Master like Mikay.

An unbelievable assessment, yet it comes directly from the elf queen.

The elf warrior was stunned and the elf queen was lost in thought.

"Lets just leave things as it is. We were lucky. We still have a territorial defense force and Phanna and Mikay agreed to leave the valley. Given who we were dealing with, this was probably the best outcome. Lets just accept that we had gotten lucky. I pray that we'll never have to see those two again" the elf queen lamented.

The elf queen's assessment only added to the feeling of discomfort in the heart of the elf warrior.

The colony was safe, their home was in tact, but the elf warrior couldn't help but to think about what might have happened otherwise.

That though was all she could think about.

The events of that fateful day replayed again and again in her until it later became carved into her soul.
