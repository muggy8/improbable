# Melody

Eventually, it was Melody's turn to take the stage once again.

I could feel her uneasinesss as she left my side.

Her opponent this time was someone who had the most reasonable fashion sense. 

No extra appendages, nothing too unorthodoxed extruding out from anywhere.

A historical looking human of the female variant. 

Though I have never seen a historical human in person myself, I do know that there has to exist a group of people who prefered using the historical human setup out there somewhere. 

Despite that, something about this person still felt slightly wrong. 

I inspected and reinspected her body but couldn't find anything that didn't seem right. 

Consiquently, I chalked that uncanny feeling up to my lack of farmiliarity with the historical human setup.

"Begin when ready" called Ethan in much the same way as before.

It didn't hit me till now but what about Melody's injuries?

I frantically looked over to check on Melody but she didn't look like she was in pain.

I then immediately looked to Amanda and asked:

"Is Melody going to be ok? isn't she injured still?"

"She should be fine..." ansewered Amanda in a rather unsure tone.

I don't know what she did but I didn't like her tone.

Her experssion also inspire any sense of confidence either. 

Looking back over to Melody's platform, I noticed that she decided to take a more defensive approach this time.

The human girl was on the offensive this time. 

Watching the two felt like watching a repeat of Melody's previous match except Melody was on the defensive this time around.

I felt a little better seeing this since she sustained her injuries from the horned boy's counter attacks last time.

The fight played out in much the same fashion as most other Sumo Boxing matches with the attacker ending up getting a hold on the defender somehow and the defender trying to shake the attacker off and counter attack after.

Melody was in a position much like the horned boy was in her last round.

But unlike the horned boy, Melody's kicks and punchs that were directed at the human girl gripping on to her did little to shaking her off.

The human girl started slowly pushing Melody back with each of her kicks until eventually, Melody got pushed off the platform.

I felt a sense of relief watching her lose without much further injuries.

Melody returned to the benches shortly after.

"Does it hurt?" Amanda asked as Melody sat down.

"Just a little" replied Melody sheepishly.

Amanda started inspecting Melody after hearing her reply.

I wanted to help but I didn't know what to do.

Maybe I can talk to her so she'll be destracted from the pain a bit?

I guess it's worth a shot. 

"What was it like out there?" I asked trying to mirror what Melody asked me earlier.

"Huh?"

Melody seemed rather surprised at my question.

"Well, I just thought I'd get the details of what happened strait from the source" I explained trying to sound like I had any idea what was happeing.

Melody was presently surprised by my statement. 

"Oh, I'm sure you could tell but we both had strengthen active but there was no way I could out muscle a Vampire with my injury." Melody explained. 

I surely had no idea what this strengthen thing is but I'll pretend I did for now but the other thing she said surprised me.

Vampire?

I gave Melody a nod and let her continue.

"Since you noticed defenders had an advantage, I thought I'd give it a shot but our base strength difference was much to big..."

Melody averted her gaze from me.

It felt like she was rather saddened by the results.

"I'm a failure..." Melody said silently as if it wasn't meant for me.

"What's wrong?" I asked.

But Melody didn't answer and just shook her head.

"Are you ok?" I asked again.

But again I got nothing. 

Seeing Melody like this reminded me of my past, the various time I've failed on my path towards creating the Organic Gravitational Wave Observatory body mod. 

There were countless times where me and the team encountered problems and had to back track.

There were countless times where we destroyed decades worth of preparation overnight. 

Thinking back on this made my stomach twist and my mind clouded with regret.

If we made just one less mistake somewhere, anywhere, our team would have been the ones to perfect the Organic Gravitational Wave Observatory system, making us forever remembered and distinguished. 

I looked over to Melody sitting there bent over with her face in her hands not sure what to say to her.

I couldn't accomplish my goal in my own world but maybe I can help Melody. 

After all, this is MY simulation and I am the god of this world.

It felt petty, but this is my world. 

If I can't succeed in my own life, maybe I can play god and help others succeed in this world.

At least for just a while. 

Just to enjoy that feeling of success.

I guess step one in this plan is to figure out what Melody's goals is. 

"Melody, what..." 

"Good work to our round 5 contestants, now, would numbers 1, 4, 5 and 9 please come up." called Ethan cutting into my question.

After Ethan's call, I watched in horror as Melody stood up next to me and marched towards the battlefield

I looked at my card once again.

A singular green dot.

Recognizing what that meant, I watched as another 6 people got up to follow after Melody.

Reluctantly, I got myself up and out of my seat and followed them towards Ethan.

By the time I got to Ethan, it was abundantly clear to me what is happening.

My round opponent was Melody.

Ethan promise a proper fight again like last round but I couldn't make that promise this time. 

I didn't even answer Ethan and made my way to the platform Melody was on.

Ethan was a bit surprised but I didn't pay much attention to him. 

"Begin when ready." he called out anyways but that was my signal to chat with Melody.

But it was Melody who spoke out first.

"Mr Phanna, I want to chat with you for a bit before we start." Melody asked firmly but softly.

Melody's words took me by surprise.

"Oh perfect, I wanted to chat too. What do you want to talk about?" I asked.

"I just want to know more about you. You've been a mystery ever since we first met."

This felt like a strange thing to ask someone before a fight like this. 

Afterall, none of my previous opponents did that, but I'm sure I'm going to be fine anyways so why not.

"Sure thing, what do you want to know about?" I replied.

"What is your home life like?"

A Mikay finatic? 

"My home life? Well right now, I'm just living with Mikay. We don't really do much since I just got here a few weeks ago. Me and Mikay don't get along too well though. um what else..."

"That sounds nice. What are your goals for the future?" Melody continued. 

This question caught me offguard. 

I though she was a Mikay finatic...

"Well... technically, I'm supposed to try to make lots of memories worth remembering but honestly, I don't want that. I just want to..."

I didn't know how to word it.

I searched for a word in my mind. 

Die? no that's probably not the best thing to say to a complete stranger.

Kill time? That would probably be too hard to explain after.

Forget? but that's just the same as making memories.

Melody didn't wait for me to find a word for too long and continued.

"Mr. Phanna, last question, what's your greatest regret?" 

Melody's voice now sounded apolegetic but the content of her question was the biggest shock to me.

I narrowed my eyes and looked away.

I had an answer.

I knew exactly what to answer.

But can I?

I guess it's worth trying

"My biggest regret... is my failure to complete a science project before the entire world got the results of that project from another world we passed by."

I felt my throat tense up saying these words but I continued. 

"Because of that, 2 of my dearest friends died... Friends closer than family... and I lost them both..."

At this point, I was fighting my emotions.

But melody stopped me.

"Thank you Mr. Phanna, I think I got a pretty good picture of who you are. What did you want to talk about?" she asked.

"Hey Melody, What's your reason for attending this exam?" I asked.

Melody was a bit taken aback by my question before she answered.
