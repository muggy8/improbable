# Melody

Eventually, it was Melody's turn to take the stage once again.

I could feel her uneasiness as she left my side.

Her opponent this time was someone who had the most reasonable fashion sense. 

No extra appendages, nothing too unorthodox extruding out from anywhere.

A historical looking human of the female variety. 

Though I have never seen a historical human in person myself, I do know that there has to exist a group of people who preferred using the historical human setup out there somewhere. 

Despite that, something about this person still felt slightly wrong. 

I inspected and reinspected her body but couldn't find anything that didn't seem right. 

Consequently, I chalked that uncanny feeling up to my lack of familiarity with the historical human setup.

"Begin when ready" called Ethan in much the same way as before.

It didn't hit me till now but what about Melody's injuries?

I frantically looked over to check on Melody but she didn't look like she was in pain.

I then immediately looked at Amanda and asked:

"Is Melody going to be ok? isn't she injured still?"

"She should be fine..." answered Amanda in a rather unsure tone.

I don't know what she did but I didn't like her tone.

Her expression also didn't inspire any sense of confidence either. 

Looking back over to Melody's platform, I noticed that she decided to take a more defensive approach this time.

The human girl was on the offensive this time. 

Watching the two felt like watching a repeat of Melody's previous match except Melody was on the defensive this time around.

I felt a little better seeing this since she sustained her injuries from the horned boy's counter-attacks last time.

The fight played out in much the same fashion as most other Sumo Boxing matches with the attacker ending up getting a hold on the defender somehow and the defender trying to shake the attacker off and counter-attack after.

Melody was in a position much like the horned boy was in her last round.

But unlike the horned boy, Melody's kicks and punches that were directed at the human girl gripping on to her did little to shaking her off.

The human girl started slowly pushing Melody back with each of her kicks until eventually, Melody got pushed off the platform.

I felt a sense of relief watching her lose without any further injuries.

Melody returned to the benches shortly after.

"Does it hurt?" Amanda asked as Melody sat down.

"Just a little" replied Melody sheepishly.

Amanda started inspecting Melody after hearing her reply.

I wanted to help but I didn't know what to do.

Maybe I can talk to her so she'll be distracted from the pain a bit?

I guess it's worth a shot. 

"What was it like out there?" I asked trying to mirror what Melody asked me earlier.

"Huh?"

Melody seemed rather surprised at my question.

"Well, I just thought I'd get the details of what happened straight from the source" I explained trying to sound like I had any idea what was happening.

Melody was presently surprised by my statement. 

"Oh, I'm sure you could tell but we both had strengthen active but there was no way I could outmuscle a Vampire with my injuries." Melody explained. 

I surely had no idea what this strengthen thing is but I'll pretend I did for now but the other thing she said surprised me.

Vampire?

I gave Melody a nod as she continued.

"Since you noticed defenders had an advantage, I thought I'd give it a shot but our base strength difference was much too big..."

Melody averted her gaze from me.

It felt like she was rather saddened by the results.

"I'm a failure..." Melody said silently as if it wasn't meant for me.

"What's wrong?" I asked.

But Melody didn't answer and just shook her head.

"Are you ok?" I asked again.

But again I got nothing. 

Seeing Melody like this reminded me of my past, the various time I've failed on my path towards creating the Organic Gravitational-Wave Observatory body mod. 

There were countless times where the team and I encountered problems and had to backtrack.

There were countless times where we destroyed decades worth of preparation overnight. 

Thinking back on this made my stomach twist and my mind clouded with regret.

If we made just one less mistake somewhere, anywhere, our team would have been the ones to perfect the Organic Gravitational-Wave Observatory system, making us forever remembered and distinguished. 

I looked over to Melody sitting there bent over with her face in her hands not sure what to say to her.

I couldn't accomplish my goal in my own world but maybe I can help Melody. 

After all, this is MY simulation and I am the god of this world.

It felt petty, but this is my world. 

If I can't succeed in my own life, maybe I can play god and help others succeed in this world.

At least for just a while. 

Just to enjoy that feeling of success.

I guess step one in this plan is to figure out what Melody's goals are. 

"Melody, what..." 

"Good work to our round 5 contestants, now, would numbers 1, 4, 5 and 9 please come up," called Ethan cutting into my question.

After Ethan's call, I watched in horror as Melody stood up next to me and marched towards the battlefield

I looked at my card once again.

A singular green dot.

Recognizing what that meant, I watched as another 6 people got up to follow after Melody.

Reluctantly, I got myself up and out of my seat and followed them towards Ethan.

By the time I got to Ethan, it was abundantly clear to me what is happening.

My round opponent was Melody.

Ethan tried to make me promise a proper fight again like last round but I couldn't make that promise this time. 

I didn't even answer Ethan and made my way to the platform Melody was on.

Ethan was a bit surprised but I didn't pay much attention to him. 

"Begin when ready," he called out anyways but that was my signal to chat with Melody.

But it was Melody who spoke out first.

"Mr. Phanna, I want to chat with you for a bit before we start," Melody asked firmly but softly.

Melody's words took me by surprise.

"Oh perfect, I wanted to chat too. What do you want to talk about?" I asked.

"I just want to know more about you. You've been a mystery ever since we first met."

This felt like a strange thing to ask someone before a fight like this. 

After all, none of my previous opponents did that, but I'm sure I'm going to be fine so why not.

"Sure thing, what do you want to know about?" I replied.

"What is your home life like?"

A Mikay fanatic? 

"My home life? Well right now, I'm just living with Mikay. We don't really do much since I just got here a few weeks ago. Mikay and I don't get along too well though. um, what else..."

"That sounds nice. What are your goals for the future?" Melody continued. 

This question caught me off guard. 

I thought she was a Mikay fanatic...

"Well... technically, I'm supposed to try to make lots of memories worth remembering but honestly, I don't want that. I just want to..."

I didn't know how to word it.

I searched for a word in my mind. 

Die? no that's probably not the best thing to say to a complete stranger.

Kill time? That would probably be too hard to explain after.

Forget? but that's just the same as making memories.

Melody didn't wait for me to find a word for too long and continued.

"Mr. Phanna, last question, what's your greatest regret?" 

Melody's voice now sounded apologetic but the content of her question was the biggest shock to me.

I narrowed my eyes and looked away.

I had an answer.

I knew exactly what to answer.

But can I?

I guess it's worth trying

"My biggest regret... is my failure to complete a science project before my world got the results of that project from another world we passed by."

I felt my throat tense up saying these words but I continued. 

"Because of that, 2 of my dearest friends died... Friends closer than family... and I lost them both..."

At this point, I was fighting my emotions.

But Melody stopped me.

"Thank you Mr. Phanna, I think I got a pretty good picture of who you are. What did you want to talk about?" she asked.

I didn't know what to feel but I was glad she stopped me. 

I made my attempt to collect myself and take a few breaths before I continued.

"Melody, I want to know what's your reason for attending this exam?"

Melody was a bit taken aback by my question before she answered. 

"I... I guess telling you is fine... This exam is me trying my best to become the person I should be." 

Melody's voice was soft and shaky.

"I've been trying my hardest for all my life and coming up short every time. I thought if I just tried a little harder, I'd be less of a burden to those around me. I wanted to give up but my sisters convinced me to give this exam a try and maybe I can succeed and learn the skills to help my family more but..."

Melody couldn't finish her sentence.

But I had a good idea about what she was going to say anyway. 

"I understand," I said empathetically as I took up a fighting stance that sort of looked like the common ones I've seen already.

I didn't intend to actually fight Melody so I didn't load any experience packs. 

After all, she's probably going to play defender again anyways, I'll just run and tackle her and get kicked off and see how this thing shakes out at the end before resetting this simulation to an earlier point.

Seeing that I've taken up a fighting stance, Melody did the same thing. 

She then looked at me and smiled before saying:

"Mr. Phanna, please allow me this one selfish act... Die."

Before I could register what she said fully, she was already dashing at me at a speed I've only seen during Parkour speedruns.

_Warnrng: threat to organic substrate detected._

_Alert: Activating emergency survival mode_

_Alert: Accelerating cognition to 300%_

The warning messages from my digital substrate flooded my mind and reverberated to every corner of my consciousness.

Yet I did not truly hear any of it. 

My body was frozen solid from shock.

A fist landed into the side of my head.

It was Melody's fist.

My vision blurred.

I was flying.

Then came the sense of pain.

It was sharp, like a hot iron on skin.

Then the sound, my carbon matrix skull echoing the sound of Melody's fist impacting against my head.

What was happening?

I didn't know. 

Then my body moved on its own.

My vision no longer blurry.

I was on my feet again somehow.

I tried to flee, but my body didn't listen.

Melody was already within striking distance.

My body still didn't listen.

Oh right, emergency survival mode.

Her leg was rapidly approaching my head again.

The sound waves coming off of her foot was being compressed.

Mach 0.8?

That was what my Gravitational-Wave Observatory was reporting.

Impact.

Against my jaw?

When did my position shift?

I expected myself to be sent flying again, but that didn't happen.

I noticed my hip to foot tendons were engaged, absorbing the impact of Melody's kick even.

And then, everything stopped.

My hands were on her leg.

When did this happen?

Before I knew it, everything was in motion again.

My vision blurred, but I could feel my body moving, not flying through the air.

Was I counter attacking?

I could feel my body turning and twisting.

I could feel my arms swinging over my head and towards the ground.

I could feel my spring-loaded legs releasing the energy they absorbed from Melody's kick and adding to my arm swing.

And then, it all stopped, again.

The sound of Calcium based bones being crushed against stone was the first thing that greeted my ears.

_Alert: threat to organic substrate neutralized._

_Alert: deactivating emergency survival mode_

_Alert: decelerating cognition to 100%_

But the notifications didn't register.

Before me was Melody's body, blood everywhere.

Crimson splattered everywhere.

The source, Melody's upper body.

Her body, facedown, her head, almost entirely disintegrated. 

Losing my footing, I fell to the ground. 

This is... This is... Impossible...

I was shaking, shaking uncontrollably.

I didn't want to see this.

I cannot accept this.

I came here to escape the traumatic memories of seeing people die.

How can this happen?

My stomach felt ill.

My whole body, shaking, rejecting the sight before me.

My mind, searching, for an escape.

Something, anything, and then...

"user reset_simulation..." I said shaken.

_Permission Denied_

"root reset_simulation" I muttered with my shaky voice remembering the commands were root commands.

_Error: simulation not found_

"ROOT RESET_SIMULATION" I shouted.

_Error: simulation not found_

I was starting to panic.

Melody's face came flooding into my mind, then suddenly exploding, blood spraying everywhere.

There was blood, everywhere.

Inside my mind, outside of my mind.

My vision, covered in blood.

Blood, it was everywhere.

Inescapable.

A hand, on my shoulder.

Who is it?

I turned to look.

Mikay.

His hand was shaking.

No, I was.

Ethan was there too.

And others, many others.

That's right, the emergency simulation exit function.

"Mikay, Ethan, this.. this.. all this is a simulation. you.. all of you.. you're all simulated.. I.. I created this whole world.. everyone.. I.. I.."

But nothing happened.

"I.. created everything here using EverSim's Infinity Simulation Pod.. I.. I.. this is all a simulation.. this.. this.."

But still, nothing.

"This.. can't be.. Dream.. Nightmare.. that's it.. This must be a nightmare.."

I pleaded, I begged, but I can't wake up.

"Please, any time now, wake up, please wake up... PLEASE WAKE UP!!!"

But nothing.

I didn't wake up in my, no, Mikay's bed.

I didn't wake up in the Infinity Simulation Pod. 

I was still here.

Still sitting in front of a corpse.

A corpse... of a person I killed... the third person I've killed...

I sat there, shaking, unsure, unable to comprehend.

What, how, why? 

I didn't understand.

Nothing made sense anymore.

Things were happening around me.

But I was unable to comprehend any of it.

The only thing I could see now is blood.

Someone was speaking to me.

But I couldn't hear them.

The only thing I could hear now is the echos of cracking bones.

_W*rni*g: u**er m***al s**te ..._

Something echoed in my mind, but I couldn't comprehend it over the sound of cracking bones... reverberating.. echoing.. intensifying. 

"Someone, something, anything.. please.. save me..."
