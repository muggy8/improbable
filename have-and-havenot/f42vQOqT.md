# Melody

Eventually, it was Melody's turn to take the stage once again.

I could feel her uneasinesss as she left my side.

Her opponent this time was someone who had the most reasonable fashion sense. 

No extra appendages, nothing too unorthodoxed extruding out from anywhere.

A historical looking human of the female variant. 

Though I have never seen a historical human in person myself, I do know that there has to exist a group of people who prefered using the historical human setup out there somewhere. 

Despite that, something about this person still felt slightly wrong. 

I inspected and reinspected her body but couldn't find anything that didn't seem right. 

Consiquently, I chalked that uncanny feeling up to my lack of farmiliarity with the historical human setup.

"Begin when ready" called Ethan in much the same way as before.

It didn't hit me till now but what about Melody's injuries?

I frantically looked over to check on Melody but she didn't look like she was in pain.

I then immediately looked to Amanda and asked:

"Is Melody going to be ok? isn't she injured still?"

"She should be fine..." ansewered Amanda in a rather unsure tone.

I don't know what she did but I didn't like her tone.

Her experssion also inspire any sense of confidence either. 

Looking back over to Melody's platform, I noticed that she decided to take a more defensive approach this time.

The human girl was on the offensive this time. 

Watching the two felt like watching a repeat of Melody's previous match except Melody was on the defensive this time around.

I felt a little better seeing this since she sustained her injuries from the horned boy's counter attacks last time.

The fight played out in much the same fashion as most other Sumo Boxing matches with the attacker ending up getting a hold on the defender somehow and the defender trying to shake the attacker off and counter attack after.

Melody was in a position much like the horned boy was in her last round.

But unlike the horned boy, Melody's kicks and punchs that were directed at the human girl gripping on to her did little to shaking her off.

The human girl started slowly pushing Melody back with each of her kicks until eventually, Melody got pushed off the platform.

I felt a sense of relief watching her lose without much further injuries.

Melody returned to the benches shortly after.

"Does it hurt?" Amanda asked as Melody sat down.

"Just a little" replied Melody sheepishly.

Amanda started inspecting Melody after hearing her reply.

I wanted to help but I didn't know what to do.

Maybe I can talk to her so she'll be destracted from the pain a bit?

I guess it's worth a shot. 

"What was it like out there?" I asked trying to mirror what Melody asked me earlier.

"Huh?"

Melody seemed rather surprised at my question.

"Well, I just thought I'd get the details of what happened strait from the source" I explained trying to sound like I had any idea what was happeing.

Melody was presently surprised by my statement. 

"Oh, I'm sure you could tell but we both had strengthen active but there was no way I could out muscle a Vampire with my injury." Melody explained. 

I surely had no idea what this strengthen thing is but I'll pretend I did for now but the other thing she said surprised me.

Vampire?

I gave Melody a nod and let her continue.

"Since you noticed defenders had an advantage, I thought I'd give it a shot but our base strength difference was much to big..."

Melody averted her gaze from me.

It felt like she was rather saddened by the results.

"I'm a failure..." Melody said silently as if it wasn't meant for me.

"What's wrong?" I asked.

But Melody didn't answer and just shook her head.

"Are you ok?" I asked again.

But again I got nothing. 

Seeing Melody like this reminded me of my past, the various time I've failed on my path towards creating the Organic Gravitational Wave Observatory body mod. 

There were countless times where me and the team encountered problems and had to back track.

There were countless times where we destroyed decades worth of preparation overnight. 

Thinking back on this made my stomach twist and my mind clouded with regret.

If we made just one less mistake somewhere, anywhere, our team would have been the ones to perfect the Organic Gravitational Wave Observatory system, making us forever remembered and distinguished. 

I looked over to Melody sitting there bent over with her face in her hands not sure what to say to her.

I couldn't accomplish my goal in my own world but maybe I can help Melody. 

After all, this is MY simulation and I am the god of this world.

It felt petty, but this is my world. 

If I can't succeed in my own life, maybe I can play god and help others succeed in this world.

At least for just a while. 

Just to enjoy that feeling of success.
