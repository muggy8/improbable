After slipping out of campus grounds, and picking up some food for myself and Phanna, I find myself once again sitting in front of the aquarium inside what's now functionally Phanna's room.

"Hey Phanna I got us some food. It might not be what you're used to but at least it's better than nothing"

"Right, and you're going to get that food into this glass box how?"

"..."

"I appreciate the thought but I should be able to maintain my biological functions under partial stasis using what I have currently... My main worry right now is water..."

Phanna began quietly monologueing about something, clearly not intending for me to hear it.

Paying no heed to Phanna I started eating the food I got for us.

The food wasn't anything special, just a fillet of fish on rice with some leafy vegetables on the side.

Phanna doesn't seem to notice that I'm eating the food already and the monologue seemed to have stopped too.

"If you carry me off to a remote location somewhere that's not as densely populated as here and release me, I think I should be able to survive whatever illness that exist in this world." Phanna said suddenly out of the blue.

"Don't worry Phanna, I have a friend who's a Cleric coming. We should be able to figure something out for you"

"Right, you're gonna use healing magic on me when I get sick, how reliable."

"Before you dismiss us, you should at least hear us out. Don't you want to find out how I did the 'impossible'?"

Phanna didn't respond, clearly not having a clever comeback.

"And how did you know we're in a populated area anyways, you've been frozen in this glass box since I left."

"Oh, while you were gone, I used my time to map out the Cosmological Background Audio. It's a set of gravitational waves that reverberates across space time since the big bang."

"There you go again spouting non-sense"

"Well you asked."

I decided to entertain this non-sense that Phanna is spouting as I had nothing else better to do while I sit here and ate.

"So what did you find out?"

"Well, against the backdrop of the Cosmological Background Audio, I could feel a bit of movement off in the distance. From the looks of it, those are people. Not as many as I'm used to though. And feeling things that far away through gravitational wave observation is a bit difficult."

"Oh, that must be the center of the town. There's often a large number of people gathered there during the day"

Honestly, whatever this gravitational wave observation thing that Phanna is able to do is actually quite impressive.

"Is that so. Towns are substantially smaller than what I thought they would be."

"So did you find anything else?"

"Well it's not what I found that surprises me, honestly it's what I didn't find."

"Oh?"

"Well I don't really sense any other lairs other than this surface. It's like there's no one else above or below us."

"Right and were would they be if they were? I thought there was no such thing as magic yet you believe in sky people?"

Phanna sighed.

"Where I'm from, we have planets that are like onions where each lair is a surface for people to live and above each lair is another lair like the previous which, of course, houses more people. We call those planets 'shell worlds' and I lived on one of those. I've never been on a natural planet in person before so all this is somewhat new to me"

"So, a roof that covers the sky?"

"Yes."

I cant even imagine completely covering the sky with a shell of some kind.

"A world like that must have been able to house an unlimited number of people."

"Nah, its got its limits. The shell I lived on had 16 continental regions. The Continental region I lived on had about three hundred trillion people living within it and probably a million times as many simulated people."

I still didn't quite understand any of that but I did get the feeling that Phanna's home world was unimaginably huge.

Given how unimaginably big Phanna's home world is described to be, I'm starting to understand why Phanna's home world would have such a strange naming convention.

I can't even imagine how annoying having one other person named Mikay around would make me feel let along a whole horde of them.

And I guess I can kind of understand Phanna's strong desire for uniqueness a little now.

Though most of the other nonsense Phanna spouts is utterly incomprehensible to me.

"You know Mikay, despite all the differences between our worlds, It's actually quite similar in a lot of other areas too."

"Oh, Phanna being sentimental for a change?"

"Nah, I did a bit of number crunching and both your universe and my universe are around the same age judging by the frequency of the Cosmological Background Audio assuming a few other variables are the same which does indeed seem that way from the surface"

"Spouting non-sense again I see. The universe is eternal, always been there, always will"

"Technically yes, since time didn't exist before the beginning of the universe, but the universe still has an age. There's still a beginning. In that sense our worlds are a lot alike."

"You know, you have a bad habit of not making sense right?"

Phanna sighed.

I also sighed as well in response.

By this time, I had already finished my food and the portion I got for Phanna, I can probably keep till tomorrow.

"So how do people in your world deal with this vaccine thing?"

"Oh, vaccines are a thing of the past where I'm from. Instead, we have a database of pathogens we download from. The data is then used to build up our resistances to the illnesses that those pathogens will cause. When we plan on migrating..."

Asking was a mistake.

Phanna stopped explaining and instead decided to read my mind.

"I have a feeling you understood none of it."

"You're not wrong..."

"Do you want me to explain further?"

"Not really."

Phanna wasn't exactly too surprised by my answer.

I also wasn't exactly in the mood to listen to Phanna ramble on either.

"Hey Phanna, by the way, I enrolled you in a local school"

Phanna chuckled

"School? What does your society have to teach me?"

"It's a school for abili... the magic of our world"

"Your..." Phanna began saying something but quickly stopped.

"What was that?" I asked.

"Nothing. don't worry about it."

It was around this time that a loud knocking came from the front door.

Phanna was understandably frightened by this, though this stasis thing is muting any motion that Phanna normally would have exhibited.

I, on the other hand, was fully expecting this to happen.

"Alright, we're going to break you out of this glass box." I declared.

"Do whatever" Phanna sighed.

I stood up from my chair and began making my way to the front door while Phanna remained motionless within the aquarium.
