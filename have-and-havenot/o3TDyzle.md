# Fight or Flight

After Ethan's callout, only one of the 4 contestant pairs jumped at each other.

The other 3 pairs of fighters were all having some sort of conversation or doing what seems to me like intimidation tactics.

I really didn't understand this whole thing.

The pair that immediately went at each other were fighting in a way that looked a bit like a mix between Sumo Wrestling and Boxing. 

At least to me. 

I was never too interested in combative sports to know anything concrete because I was more of a parkour kind of person. 

Despite my last parkour run being hundreds of years ago, I still have some memories of my parkour days that haven't been archived.

Based on my parkour experiance, I felt like the footwork of the sumo boxers were rather lacking.

Looking around, I noticed that manyof the students around me were focused on another pair.

I followed their gaze towards a pair of combatants who seemed to just be talking. 

I didn't know why everyone was looking but I felt like I should probably be looking at them too.

After all, even if this world is generated by random, I'd at least expect thinking entities to be behaving in logical and rational ways.

One of the contestants on the platform everyone was looking at seemed like a female variant of her species. 

She had long sharp ears on the side of her head like mine but she didn't have another set on top of her head.

This told me she didn't have my gravitational wave observation ability since my setup requires detectors on 3 axes. 

Her opponent seemed more like the male variant of his species. 

He also had ears like mine except his were at the top of his head instead of the side.

He also seemed to have a tail of some sort too.

Quite the bold fashion statement.  

The two of them talked for a bit before finally getting into some sort of fighting stance that I didn't recognize and from the looks of it, they're the last ones to get started.

I guess when Ethan said "Begin when ready" he really meant it and the prospective students are making full use of that readying time. 

In a blink and you'll miss it moment, the tailed boy leaped at the pointy eared girl.

He clawed at her but she caught his hand mid strike and returned a low sweep.

Surprisingly, it didn't knock him over as her kick bounced off his shin.

Taking advantage of that, the tailed boy kicked with his other leg.

The girl evaded the attack by jumping back.

Upon landing, she immediately leaped forwards again trying to attack but the tailed boy has already regaind his ballence.

As she closed in, she lead with what looked like a strong punch which the tailed boy blocked with ease. 

But she immediately followed up with a series of quick jabs which were all easily blocked.

Despite her relentless attacks, the tailed boy didn't seem to be too bothered at all yet for some reason, the tailed boy retreated backwords after a few hits. 

Funny enough, the pointy eared girl didn't jump in to continue her attacks but instead she began talking again. 

Despite the chat, both fighters maintained their combat stance unlike how they were during chat before the fight started. 

I took this moment to glance at the other fights and they all looked like they were doing the sumo boxing thing the first pair were. 

In fact, the first pair seemed to have finished their fight and are already making their way back to the benches.

I returned my gaze to the arena with the pointy eared girl and the tailed boy just in time to catch them engaging each other again.

The tailed boy continued to initiate the attack by jumping towards the girl while throwing a punch.

She didn't react at all and just took the hit with her cheek.

The tailed boy's attack looked like it would have sent the pointy eared girl flying but for some reason, she only slightlylost her footing but overall, she didn't move much. 

She stood her ground and grabbed the tailed boy's arm that was connected to her face.

With a firm grip on her target, she started hitting the boy in rapid succession.

The tailed boy made his best attempt to block her punches with his free hand but it didn't seem like it was working.

Yet as they continued, it was very clear what was going on.

The tailed boy was getting pushed back.

The pointy eared girl's hold on him enesured that he was in striking range as well as controlling which direction he could retreat in.

It looked like the tailed boy was just a single step away from falling off the stage when, suddenly, he caugh one of the girl's punches by her wrist and had her arm firmly held in his palm.

He the proceeds to throw her outside of the platform in one smooth motion.

I could hear gasps in the crowd as this happened.

I wasn't exactly too sure what just happened but it seemed like a big deal. 

The girl didn't look happy as she stood up and walked over to the benches.

The tailed boy also got off of the stage and walked over too.

Although the fight sort of made sense when being observed with regular vision, watching the fight play out with gravitational waves made absolutelyno sense.

Both fighters were not heavy or dense enough to completely ignore attacks like they did.

Is this a bug in the simulation code?

Maybe I should report it to the devs.

But then again, this world looks like it has something like magic in it given how Mikay made my shoes today morning so maybe it's not a bug in the simulation code but just a cleaver application of whatever magic they have.

I have heard that fantacy worlds are popular simulation destination with a certain group of people so a simulated world with magic doesn't seem that out there.

First it's karma and now magic. 

This world is getting less and less realistic by the minute. 

I notice the pointy eared girl sitting down near me. 

There was another girl between us. 

The girl beside me and the pointy eared girl seemed to know each other and they began chatting.

I couldn't help but to eavesdrop a bit.

"That was unfortunate. Who would have thought you'd meet Leon in the first round."

"Tell me about it, I thought I got him too."

"What happened out there sis?"

"I started out with observe and strengthen active and I saw that he had two instances of strengthen active. He didn't activate another instance of strengthen no matter what I did so I thought he couldn't"

"So you switched over to two instances of strengthen too right."

"Exactly, I thought I had it in the bags when I grabbed his hand and started pushing him back but he surprised me at the end by activating his third instance of strengthen."

"Well, you tried your best sis, but Leon is just too strong."

"Melody, you're getting it all wrong, failure is failure even if you've tried your best or not."

"S-sorry..."

"In the real world, trying your best won't do you any good if you still fail at the end."

"Yes..."

"Anyways, looks like the next round is about to start. See if you're your turn this round."

"Y-yes!"

The two stopped their chatter just as Ethan began shouting again.

"Good work to our round 1 contestants, now, would colours orange, gray, green and black please come up."

I looked down at my card to double check.

On it was a green dot.

I guess that meant it's my turn.

I got up and walked over to Ethan as did 7 other students around me.

We formed a line and Ethan had a short chat with each of us before telling us which platform we should go to.

Of course, I positioned myself at the end of the line.
