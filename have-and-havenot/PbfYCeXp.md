# Ramblings

After making my way out of the school grounds successfully, I found myself without much else to do.

It’s only around 4 in the afternoon but I can’t go home empty-handed because of the promise I made to Phanna.

Maybe I should get some food for us. I had a feeling that Phanna hasn’t had any food for a while.

I should probably get something nice to celebrate a successful summoning.

Then again, I distinctly remember the previous summons saying that the food here tasted bland or something.

I wonder what I should get… maybe I should stick to a safer option like fish.

I made my way to the river near the edge of town to attempt to catch a fish.

On the way, I noticed a few people leaving the river with disappointed looks.

It didn’t take a genius to figure out that they too were here to catch fish but luck wasn't on their side.

I made my way to the river banks and walked into the river scanning my surroundings.

The fish here wasn’t big, nothing like the fish that could be caught from the sea, but it’s still enough to feed both Phanna and me, probably.

I noticed the silhouette of a fish in the water and activated my Forgemaster ability targeting the area in the riverbed below it.

The river is fortunately not that deep and I had an entire section of the river covered by my Sphere of Influence.

In one swift motion, I lifted a tube of clay out of the riverbed through the water using Forgemaster until the tube was in the air. The fish I had my eye on was trapped within the tube of clay.



I then squished the tube and lowered it until finally, it became a small narrow tube with my catch, the fish, trapped inside of it.

With my catch in hand, I made my way back home.

On the way home, I got some rice from the neighbor who owed me a favor.

Once I entered my home, I called out to Phanna to make it clear that it was me.

“Phanna, I’m back. I got us some food. I got a friend of mine who’s a healer to pay us a visit after dinner.”

…

“Ok”, said Phanna in the usual half-dead voice muffled by the glass inside the room.

After getting Phanna’s response, I placed the bucket of steamed rice on a table and started cooking.

The result was 5 wooden skewers full of fish meat.



It wasn’t anything special but it was a rather safe choice since I didn’t know what kind of food Phanna liked.

With the fish now on a plate and the bucket of rice in hand, I made my way back to the room Phanna was currently in but I was shocked by the sight in front of me.

Phanna was no longer in the aquarium.

The lid of the aquarium had been moved slightly and there was a small gap at the top.

I looked around the room quickly and noticed Phanna laying down in the bed by the door hugging Pillow.

Pillow was, understandably, rather alarmed and was squirming like crazy trying to escape from Phanna’s hug.



“Phanna?! What are you doing!!” I shouted in shock.

“Hugging this stress toy here. Seeing you hug it earlier made me want to give it a try too”

“No! I mean what are you doing outside of the Aquarium?”

“To hug the stress toy?”

I let out a long sigh in disbelief.

I didn’t know what to do or say.

“Are you feeling ok? Is there anything wrong? How’s your temperature…”

The questions kept coming

I was worried.

I didn’t even know if Phanna will be able to help save my daughter but…

“Hey, Mikay… Someone’s knocking on the door…”

“What…”

I listened carefully again and sure enough, there’s a knock.

It must be Ethan

I left the food on the table and quickly rushed to open the front door and sure enough, Ethan was standing there looking a bit nervous or was he excited.

I felt a bit relieved seeing him here already.

“Good thing you’re here already!” I said and quickly grabbed him by the hand and lead him to the room Phanna’s in.

Ethan was rather startled by my actions but still he followed me into the room Phanna’s in.

Phanna was still hugging the squirming Pillow and doesn’t seem to have moved at all upon our return.

“I-is this Phanna?” Ethan asked.

“I guess that’s my name now” Phanna answered uncaringly as usual.

“Yes, this is my new Champion, Phanna. Can you check if Phanna’s ill in any way right now?”.

Ethan gave me a look of confusion.

“I’m perfectly fine right now. No illnesses whatsoever”, protested Phanna.

Ignoring Phanna’s protests, I continued to explain to Ethan, “You know very well what happened to my last champion. I want to prevent that from happening so I summoned Phanna inside Pillow’s aquarium but Phanna got out.”

“Y-you performed the summoning ritual in an aquarium?!”

Ethan was surprised.

“Not now, please”

“R-right. I’ll begin examining Phanna now.”

Ethan turned towards Phanna…

“Phanna, can you let go of Pillow for a bit?”

“Hmmm… I want it back after.”

“Sure thing” Ethan agreed.

Phanna released Pillow and the panicked Pillow immediately jumped off the bed.

I guess slimes have it rough too sometimes.

After that, Ethan lifted his hands over Phanna and closed his eyes.

I walked over to the corner of the room to pick up the scared and trembling Pillow as I know exactly what Ethan’s doing now.

I’ve seen it a couple of times and he’s even explained it to me before.

Though I don’t have the required knowledge to pull it off myself, I do know the basic idea of it.

The first step is to use a combination of an observation ability and any ability that causes vibrations in the target to be observed.

The second step is to identify anything abnormal within the target.

Once that’s done, the rest is just about finding a treatment to restore things to the way they’re supposed to be.

This process normally requires the patient's consent to let the healer violate their Sphere of Influence.

However, since Phanna was summoned recently and doesn’t have a Sphere of Influence, that step can be skipped.

I returned to the side of the bed and that’s when Ethan spoke again.

“Phanna… How are you still alive?”

Phanna answered the question with a confused look.

“What do you mean how is Phanna still alive?” I asked Ethan.

I was concerned.

Very concerned.

“Phanna’s internals are completely misplaced with some parts probably missing.”

“Uh what? my internals?” Phanna puzzled.

“Um well, your bones seem to be there but also not there, the stuff in your lower abdomen is completely unrecognizable. Normally I use the heart and the reproductive organ as a point of reference to identify the other organs, but, I cannot identify anything resembling reproductive organs inside you.”

I didn’t fully understand what Ethan said but whatever it meant, it definitely sounded like it was extremely serious.

My mind started racing.

I didn’t know what to do.

It seems like this summoning was a failure after all.

What other options do I have left?

Is this it?

Is there no way of saving my daughter?

“Master Mikay, are you alright?”

Ethan interrupted my thoughts.

I glanced back.

“Honestly, I’m not sure if I am…”

Phanna somehow got hold of Pillow again.

“Master Mikay, I think you should sit down for a bit,” said Ethan as he sat me down into a chair that he got from across the room.

“What’s Phanna’s condition like…?” I asked.

“I’m sorry but I really don’t know…”, Ethan answered.

“I already told you again and again. I’m perfectly fine.” Phanna insisted.

“How can you be so sure about this?” I questioned.

But I didn’t get a proper response.

Instead, Phanna sat up and handed Pillow to me.

“Here, you need this stress toy more than I do,” Phanna said.

There was something different about Phanna’s voice this time.

I then realized that Phanna’s voice didn’t sound half-dead for the first time and instead sounded like concern.

I held Pillow in my arms as Phanna got off the bed and started eating the food I brought in earlier.

“Master Mikay, I’ll do everything in my power to ensure that Phanna survives the potential upcoming illness,” Ethan whispered to me in a concerned voice as I sat there spacing out.

I gave him a weak nod as he departed my side and approached Phanna.

“Excuse me Phanna, I’m not sure if you’d know anything about your body but if you do, can you please tell us about it?”

“Not sure how that’d help but sure. Where do you want to start.”

“Could you tell me about your bone structure? It didn’t look like anything I’ve ever seen before.”

“Sure, I have 3 different types of bones but they all fall under the category of Carbon Matrix. The first type, straight bones, is made of a diamond rod surrounded by various cables of carbon nanotubes held in place by tensile force with joints made of fat-filled graphene sacks which convert and distribute sheer force during impact into compressive force for the diamond core. The second type is for stiff structures that aren’t straight like my hip and skull. These bones are made of Interlocking Graphene Origami…”

“I’m sorry to interrupt but I didn’t understand any of it…”

“See, I told you it’d be useless right?”

“W-well what about your reproductive organs?”

“Don’t have any.”

“Uhh… how does reproduction happen then?”

“By filling in a lot of forms.”

“How… What?”

“A group of prospective parents would fill in an application to reproduce and if approved, genetic information is sent to a bio lab for reproduction. Up to 100 genes can be assigned to be passed down from each parent with some restrictions and the rest is randomized between all parents for ethical reasons. The resulting gene sequence is then used by a bio factory to create a new child.”

“I didn’t understand any of that other than you being genderless like Pillow.”

“Sexless is the technical term but I guess genderless is also correct.”

Ethan didn’t seem to like Phanna’s answer all that much.

I let out a sigh as I got up, placed Pillow on the floor, walked over to the desk by the wall, and began eating the food too.

“Ethan, thanks for trying but I doubt there’s anything we can do now.”

Ethan wasn’t looking in my direction.

I wasn’t looking in his direction either.

“I think fish on rice would taste better if the fish was raw and the rice was salted.”

I found myself ignoring Phanna’s comment completely.

Maybe I’m just so used to Phanna spouting non-sense that strange comments like this don’t even feel that strange coming from Phanna anymore.

“Sure whatever” I found myself muttering in response.

Ethan, on the other hand, did seem to be a bit surprised and decided to reply to Phanna.

“Phanna, I’m not sure what your homeworld is like but eating raw anything is bad for your karma. If your karma is bad enough, then you’ll get sick. If your karma gets worse… Phanna what are you laughing at?”

Before Ethan was able to finish, Phanna let out a chuckle which prompted Ethan to stop.

“Oh, it just about how weird this whole situation feels and how Ethan seems to be so serious about it”

“You don’t believe me?”

“Nah I do, but that’s the other half of why I was laughing. A karma system in a world like this just feels so out of place. It feels like a thematically incoherent mess.”

“What do you mean?” Ethan puzzled.

I, on the other hand, have completely given up on this topic instead I am now just focused on eating.

“In my homeworld, illness is caused by microscopic parasites.”

“Microscopic?”

“It means very small, smaller than the eye can see, small enough that you’ll need special tools called microscopes in order to see it. That’s how small microscopic things are.”

“How would a single tiny parasite like that be the cause of illnesses? that seems much more unbelievable than karma.”

“I didn’t say a single microscopic parasite causes illnesses. When it’s just one, it’s no problem. But when the single one starts reproducing inside your body and become a whole colony, then it becomes a problem.”

“I think I’d rather not have a countless number of parasites feeding off my body as the source of disease,” Ethan said in disgust.

“Neither would I,” Phanna agreed.

“I guess it’s good that you’re here then,” I interjected.

but Phanna didn’t respond much

“Y…yah I guess” was the only thing Phanna said and again back in the lifeless half-dead voice.

Ethan looked over to me unsure of what to make of this situation.

I replied by shaking my head.

I had just as little idea of what’s going on in Phanna’s head as he does, in fact, probably less as I had already given up on trying to understand Phanna.

Phanna didn’t say much after that point for the rest of the day other than asking for water.

I wasn’t sure how, but Phanna got hold of Pillow again and the two of them spent the rest of the day together, much to Pillow’s displeasure.

Ethan and I started preparing rituals for increasing Phanna’s Karma.

Hopefully, we can increase Phanna’s karma enough to avoid a repeat of my previous champion.
