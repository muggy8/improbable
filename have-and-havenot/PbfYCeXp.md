# Realization

After making my way out of the school grounds successfully, I found myself without much stuff to do. 

It's only around 4 in the afternoon but I can't go home empty handed because of the promise i made to Phanna.

Maybe I should get some food for us. I'm pretty sure Phanna hasn't had any food for a while.

I should probably get something nice to celebrate a successfull summoning.

Then again, I distinctly remember the previous summon said the food tasted bland or something.

I wonder what I should get... maybe i should stick to a safer option like fish.

I made my way to the river near the edge of town and made my attempt at catching fish as I noticed a few people make their way away from the river with dissapointed looks.

I didn't take a genius to figure out that they too were here to catch fish but didn't manage to catch any.

I made my way to the river banks and walked into the river scanning my surroundings.

the fish here wasn't that big, nothing like the fish caught from the sea, but it's still enough to fill the stomach. 

I noticed the silhoete of a fish in the water and activated my Forgemaster ability targeting the an area in the riverbed below it. 

The river is fortunately not that deep and I had an entire section of the river covered by my Sphere of Influence. 

in one swift motion, I lifted a tube of clay out of the river bed above the water and the fish I had my eye on was trapped in it.

I then squished the tube and lowered it until finally, it became a bucket with my catch inside of it. 

I had also unintentionally gathered a small crowd of spectators.

I gave them a wave, grabbed hold of my catch, desolved the pipe i made and quickly left the river.

With my catch in hand, I made my way back home and remebering to pick up some cooked rice along the way as well as visiting the butcher to get the fish I had just caught cut up.

Once I entered the my home, I called out to Phanna to make it clear that it was me.

"Phanna, I'm back. I got us some food. I got a friend of mine who's a clerk to pay me a visit after dinner."

...

"Ok"

Of course, the usual half dead voice muffled by the glass and the room.

After getting the responce, I placed the bucket of steamed rice on a table started to cook.

The result was 5 wooden sticks full of fish meat stabbed onto each of the sticsk. 

It wasn't really anything special but it was a rather safe choice since I didn't know what kind of food Phanna likes.

With fish on plate and rice bucket in hand, I made my way back to the room Phanna was in currently and became shocked at the sight that I saw.

Phanna was no longer in the aquarium. 

The lid of the aquarium has been moved slighly and there was a small gap at the top.

I looked around the room quickly and noticed phanna laying down in the bed by the door hugging Pillow.

Pillow was, understandably, rather alarmed and is squerming like crazy all over the place. 

"Phanna?! What are you doing!!" I shouted in shock.

"Hugging the stress relief toy here. Seeing you hug it earlier made me want to give it a try too"

"No! I mean what are you doing outside of the Aquarium?"

"To hug the stress toy?"

I let out a long sigh in disbelief. 

I didn't know what to do or say.

"Are you feeling ok? is there anything wrong? How's your temperture..."

The questions kept coming

I was worried.

I didn't ven know if Phanna will be able to help save my daughter but...

"Hey, Mikay... Someone's knocking on the door..."

"Wha..."

I listened carefully again and sure enough, there's a knock. 

It must be Ethan

I quickly rushed to the open the door and sure enough, Ethan's standing there looking a bit nervious or was it excited. 

I felt a bit relieved seeing him here already. 

"Good thing you're here already!" I said and quickly grabbed him by the hand and lead him to the room Phanna's in.

Ethan's understandably rather startled by my actions as he followed me to the room Phanna's in. 

Phanna's still hugging the sqerming Pillow and doesn't seem to have moved at all upon our return.

"I-is this Phanna?" Ethan asked.

"I guess that's my name now" Phanna answered uncaringly as usual. 

"Yes, this is my new Champion, Phanna. But that's not important right now. Can you check if Phanna's ill in any way right now?".

Ethan gave me a look of confusion

"I'm perfectly fine right now. no illnesses what so ever" protested Phanna

Ignoring Phanna's protests, I continued to explain to Ethan, "You know very well what happend to my last champion. I want to avoid that from happening so I summoned Phanna in Pillow's aquarium but Phanna got out"

"Y-you performed the summoning ritual in an aquarium?!" 

Ethan was supprised.

"Not now, please"

"R-right. I'll begin examining Phanna now."

Ethan turned towards Phanna...

"Phanna, can you let go of Pillow for a bit?"

"Hmmm... I want it back after."

"Sure thing" Ethan agreed. 

Phanna let go of Pillow and ths paniced Pillow immediately jumpped off the bed. 

I guess slimes have it rough too.

Ethan lifted his hands over Phanna and closed his eyes.

I walked over to the corner of the room to pick up the scared and trembeling Pillow as I know exactly what Ethan's  doing.

I've seen it a couple times and he's even explained it to me before. 

Though I dont have the knowledge to pull it off myself, I do know the basic idea of it. 

First step is to use a combination of observation and an ability that causes vibrations to observe the inside of someone's body

Second step is to identify anything abnormal within the target.

Once that's done, the rest is just about finding a treatment to restore things to the way they're supposed to be. 

This process normally requires the patent's consent as it needs to violating their Sphere of Influence. 

However, since Phanna was summoned recently and doesn't have a Sphere of Influence, that step can be skipped.
