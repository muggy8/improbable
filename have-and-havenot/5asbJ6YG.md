# Summoning

"Good work to our round 5 contestants, now, would numbers 1, 4, 5 and 9 please come up," called Ethan.

Against my body's request, I stood up and made my way to Ethan in agony.

I could hear Amanda's disappointment as I stood up and left the benches.

At this point, this feeling was all too farmiliar.

I tried my best but my best was never enough. 

Not before, not today either. 

The sharp pain in my chest radiated but at this point, my mind was elsewhere, occupied by other pains.

All I've ever been was a waste of resources.

I was never able to produce and results no matter how hard I tried.

Even this exam, I didn't even deserve to be here.

"Think you'd be able to continue?" asked Ethan as I approached him.

I gave him a weak nod.

He gave me a concerned look and pointed to the closest platform.

"I won't stop you but do try to take care of yourself ok?" 

I weakly nodded back to him and made my way towards him.

What's left to take care of? I thought to myself.

If I got accepted into the school of Mastery and worked hard, I'd be able to become strong.

Then I'd be appreciated, valued, and I'd be looked at as more than just some burden.

Yet deep down, I knew that all that was just wishful thinking.

This whole exam thing was over for me before it even began.

Why did I even try?

I'm a failure... I should have never been born...

...

Soon enough, my opponent for this round was before me climbing onto the stage.

He was the strange half elf boy named Phanna.

He doesn't seem to use Abilities at all yet he is somehow able to fight on even footing against Amanda. 

I felt like there was a world of difference between us.

Here, infront of me, was a person who seemed to have all the talent in the world.

And then, there was me, a total failure who can't even keep up with basic field practice.

I was jealous, why can't I be like Phanna, why am I such a failure, why am I even here...

"Begin when ready," called Ethan after Phanna gotten onto the platform.
