# Summoning

"Good work to our round 5 contestants, now, would numbers 1, 4, 5 and 9 please come up," called Ethan.

Against my body's request, I stood up and made my way to Ethan in agony.

I could hear Amanda's disappointment as I stood up and left the benches.

At this point, this feeling was all too farmiliar.

I tried my best but my best was never enough. 

Not before, not today either. 

The sharp pain in my chest radiated but at this point, my mind was elsewhere, occupied by other pains.

All I've ever been was a waste of resources.

I was never able to produce and results no matter how hard I tried.

Even this exam, I didn't even deserve to be here.

"Think you'd be able to continue?" asked Ethan as I approached him.

I gave him a weak nod.

He gave me a concerned look and pointed to the closest platform.

"I won't stop you but do try to take care of yourself ok?" 

I weakly nodded back to him and made my way away from him.

What's left to take care of? I thought to myself.

If I got accepted into the school of Mastery and worked hard, I'd be able to become strong.

Then I'd be appreciated, valued, and I'd be looked at as more than just some burden.

Yet deep down, I knew that all that was just wishful thinking.

This whole exam thing was over for me before it even began.

Why did I even try?

I'm a failure... I should have never been born...

...

Soon enough, my opponent for this round was before me climbing onto the stage.

He was the strange half elf boy named Phanna.

He doesn't seem to use Abilities at all yet he is somehow able to fight on even footing against Amanda. 

I felt like there was a world of difference between us.

Here, infront of me, was a person who seemed to have all the talent in the world.

And then, there was me, a total failure who can't even keep up with basic field practice.

I was jealous, why can't I be like Phanna, why am I such a failure, why am I even here...

"Begin when ready," called Ethan after Phanna gotten onto the platform. 

"Mr. Phanna, I want to chat with you for a bit before we start," I asked firmly but softly.

Phanna's reacted with a bit of surprise at my question but he quickly replied.

"Oh perfect, I wanted to chat too. What do you want to talk about?" 

"I-I just want to know more about you. You've been a mystery ever since we first met." I replied trying my best to give a clean answer.

I felt bad.

I was a total failure.

Phanna was the exact opposit.

Yet here I am, using Phanna as a tool for finding my own escape from my own existance. 

The least I can do is to get to know him before we start this.

"Sure thing, what do you want to know about?" Phanna replied. 

"What is your home life like?" I asked. 

Phanna hesitated for a bit at my question  and didn't seem to know how to answer.

Is there something Phanna doesn't want to talk about?

But eventually the answer did come.

"My home life? Well right now, I'm just living with Mikay. We don't really do much since I just got here a few weeks ago. Mikay and I don't get along too well though. um, what else..." 

"That sounds nice. What are your goals for the future?" I asked as I didn't let Phanna continue.

Part of me hurted with jealousy hearing this and the other part of me didn't want to pry too much out of Phanna if he didn't want to talk about it.

"Well... technically, I'm supposed to try to make lots of memories worth remembering but honestly..."

Phanna's voice trailed off towards the end.

Making memories?

How I wish I can be that carefree.

"I don't want that. I just want to..." Phanna continued.

But didn't finish his setatment.

He seems to be grasping at something that never came.

I gave him a bit of time but he didn't proceed to say anything further.

I wasn't sure why this question was so hard to answer yet I knew that if I was asked the same question, i'd have a hard time answering as well. 

After all, who'd want to give up their own life.

"Mr. Phanna, last question, what's your greatest regret?" I asked breaking the mood.

Phanna seemed shocked at my question.

Honestly, I would be too.

But all I'm asking him is about his present, future and past.

Phanna hesitated a bit but he eventually did answer.

"My biggest regret... is my failure to complete a science project before my world got the results of that project from another world we passed by."

My world?

Another Wolrld?

That sounded like crazy talk to me.

"Because of that, 2 of my dearest friends died... Friends closer than family... and I lost them both..."

Phanan's words were shaky.

Despite Phanna's odd answer, I could feel the emotions in his words.

The emotions behind those words and how hard they were to speek, I could feel it all.

I felt bad that this was the person who ended up opposit to me today.

He was the exact opposit of what I am.

Yet here I am planning to bring an end both of us.

"Thank you Mr. Phanna, I think I got a pretty good picture of who you are. What did you want to talk about?" I said trying to lighten the mood; partially for Phanna and partially for me.

"Melody, I want to know what's your reason for attending this exam?"

"I... I..."

W-why was Phanna asking me of this?

"I guess telling you is fine... This exam is me trying my best to become the person I should be." I said bitterly.

Was...

That's no longer what this exam is for me anymore.

"I've been trying my hardest for all my life and coming up short every time. I thought if I just tried a little harder, I'd be less of a burden to those around me."

The only reason I even exist today is because my tribe didn't want to get rid of me in fear of Karma related reasons.

I knew this and they knew that I knew.

But i didn't want to continue living like that anymore.

To be looked at as a burned, to be treated like Im a waste of everything. 

If only i didn't exist...

"I wanted to give up but my sisters convinced me to give this exam a try and maybe I can succeed and learn the skills to help my family more but..."

My words were shaky but I continued to talk but Phanna stopped me.

"I understand," he said trying to make me feel better.

As if you would. I thought to myself.

You're perfect in every way, and I'm the exact opposit.

Phanan took up a strange fighting stance and I did too.

The sharp pain in my chest was still there and yet I ignored it.

I gave Phanna a smile as I uttered my goodbye to him.

"Mr. Phanna, please allow me this one selfish act... Die."

Before I finished my phrase, I was already leaping at him.

I didn't have much of a chance to win under normal circumstance but with a surprise attack, maybe it can work.

If not, then, at the very least, he would be able to counter attack and end me.

I charged at Phanna with nothing held back.

Quicken gave me a boost, but will that be enough?

My fist connected with Phanna's face without him putting up much resistance.

The recoil from the impact echoed thorugh my body and I could feel pain explode from my chest as this happend.

I caughed up some blood but I didn't care.

The next striked will be it I'm sure.
