# Uncharted Territories

Phanna and Melody spent a long time chatting with each other on their platform.

I noticed one of the other matches was about to finish from the corner of my eyes but I didn't really pay attention to them.

My main objective here was to observe Phanna so I can't really afford to miss a single moment of Phanna's matches.

Good thing the other judges had all the matches covered, so I could pick and choose which matches I wanted to watch.

Phanna being able to mostly keep up with Amanda who was using two instances of Strengthen was a surprise for sure.

If only Phanna did that during their first match.

Soon enough, I could see Melody activating a physical type ability but before I could react, Melody charged towards Phanna in a blur.

Before I could react Phanna was flying across the arena. 

Wait, that was Quicken and not Strengthen?

I was shocked, in pain even, like a fist impacting against my unprotected gut.

Many things raced across my mind.

Is Phanna still ok?

Would Phanna survive?

Why isMelody doing this?

I Instinctively activated 3 instances of Quicken and 3 instances of Strengthen and dashed towards Phanna's platform.

The world around me blured but the center of my vision stayed constant.

Phanna.

I have to make it to Phanna.

Phanna flipped over mid air and landed on their legs.

Wait how is that possible?

Is Phanna still conscious?

But I didn't get a chance to think as Melody was already following up with a spinning kick.

Phanna didn't seem to budge as Melody appronched.

I felt as if the world slowed down.

Phanna, evade!

I wanted to call out.

But it was all too late.

Melody's foot connected with Phanna's jaw and I felt a strange pain bolted across my whole body.

It's all over...

My dash slowed, my hope shattered.

But as I slowed down, the most unexpected happened, Phanna counter attacked.

Phanna's jaw was still fully connected, head still attached, and arms on melody's leg.

And then, a strong overhead swing.

I watched in horror as Melody collided with the floor. 

Blood and bones splattered everywhere.

A significant amount got splattered onto me but I was stunned, mentally and physically.

It was that moment, I realized...

Phanna is nothing like anything I know.

I don't know how much time has passed but I saw Phanna fall over and I quickly snapped back to reality and rushed over to Phanna's side.

"Phanna are you ok?" I shouted.

But Phanna didn't give me a proper responce

I placed my hand on Phanna's shoulder again and tried again.

"Phanna are you ok?!"

Phanna looked at me with eyes full of shock and pain and mouth wide open.

I didn't need an answer to know that Phanna was not ok. 

I could feel Phanna's shivers with the hand I had on their shoulder.

"Mikay, Ethan, this.. this.. all this is a simulation. you.. all of you.. you're all simulated.. I.. I created this whole world.. everyone.. I.. I.." Phanna muttered.

As Phanna spoke, I noticed that Ethan has arrived as well.

Multiple other teachers were around too and many more were trying to control the students and the examines.

I looked over to Ethan and he was also quite shocked by the events.

But my mind was only on Phanna.

"Ethan, c-check on how Phanna's doing!" I barked.

“B-but... I... I have to... I... I...“ 

"Ethan... I need you..."

"B-but... Melody... I... I... have to... check on... her"

Melody? she's already dead.

Why would you care about Melody.

Phanna's still alive and injured. 

Phanna needs youmore than Melody.

A torrent of thoughts and emotions raced across my mind yet for some reason, I didn't voice any of them.

Perhaps I already knew why, perhaps I knew Ethan's decision is correct.

But all I felt right now was betrayed.

I grabbed Phanna with both hands and started trying to wake Phanna up. 

"Phanna! Phanna! get a hold of yourself!" I shouted..

Instead, all I got were some comments about dreams or waking up.

"Phanna! Phanna! Wake up!" I shouted over and over again. 

But no response.

The last thing Phanna said was a plea to be saved.

After that, Phanna passed out. 

The only thing that kept me calm enough to function was the fact that Phanna was still breathing.

I placed my hand placed on Phanna's chest to monitor their breathing.

In a way, this was more for my sake than for Phanna's since it helped me stay calm knowing that Phanna's still alive.

I looked over to Ethan and Melody eagerly waiting for him to come over to check on Phanna.

I couldn't help but feel a bit saddened by both Melody and Ethan.

Ethan and I both knew that Melody was beyond saving.

Yet his duties as the cleric and as the principal of the school demands that he at least try to do something for Melody.

A fruitless struggle that must continue.

But Melody was the one who saddened me more.

Melody was so much like Ethan when I first tested him too.

Her drive to give 100% all the time, to keep pushing despite the odds.

I felt like I've failed her, not only her but also Ethan and the future of the school and the Mastery League and the northern mountain elven tribe...

I shoudn't have slowed down, I should have kept running, maybe I could have made it in time to save her.

Maybe I could have saved Phanna too if I had realized sooner.

Was this whole exam a mistake?

Was Phanna right all along and that coming to this exam was a mistake?

I don't have the answer but all I have now is my lingering regrets.

"M-Master Mikay, w-what should we do?" asked a teacher beside me interupting my thoughts.

I recognized her.

She was Emily, a teacher whom I used to teach with. 

She was probably the second in command here considering she had and probably still has 2 Innate Abilities to call her own.

Actually, I guess I'm technically the one who should be in charge here since I have 4 Innate Abilities and I was a former teacher.

That would make Emily third in command I guess.

I glanced down to Phanna laying on the ground beside me and then to the panicked students and even some panicked teachers.

Emily seemed like she was barely holding it together herself.

"Contact the Mastery League main branch to report the situation and ask for assistance and guidance. The long range communicator should be in the principal's office. Do you know what it looks like?"

Emily gave me a nod and ran off.
