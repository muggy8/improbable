# Uncharted Territories

Phanna and Melody spent a long time chatting with each other on their platform.

I noticed one of the other matches was about to finish from the corner of my eyes but I didn't really pay attention to them.

My main objective here was to observe Phanna so I can't really afford to miss a single moment of Phanna's matches.

Good thing the other judges had all the matches covered, so I could pick and choose which matches I wanted to watch.

Phanna being able to mostly keep up with Amanda who was using two instances of Strengthen was a surprise for sure.

If only Phanna did that during their first match.

Soon enough, I could see Melody activating a physical type ability but before I could react, Melody charged towards Phanna in a blur.

Before I could react Phanna was flying across the arena. 

Wait, that was Quicken and not Strengthen?

I was shocked, in pain even, like a fist impacting against my unprotected gut.

Many things raced across my mind.

Is Phanna still ok?

Would Phanna survive?

Why isMelody doing this?

I Instinctively activated 3 instances of Quicken and 3 instances of Strengthen and dashed towards Phanna's platform.

The world around me blured but the center of my vision stayed constant.

Phanna.

I have to make it to Phanna.

Phanna flipped over mid air and landed on their legs.

Wait how is that possible?

Is Phanna still conscious?

But I didn't get a chance to think as Melody was already following up with a spinning kick.

Phanna didn't seem to budge as Melody appronched.

I felt as if the world slowed down.

Phanna, evade!

I wanted to call out.

But it was all too late.

Melody's foot connected with Phanna's jaw and I felt a strange pain bolted across my whole body.

It's all over...

My dash slowed, my hope shattered.

But as I slowed down, the most unexpected happened, Phanna counter attacked.

Phanna's jaw was still fully connected, head still attached, and arms on melody's leg.

And then, a strong overhead swing.

I watched in horror as Melody collided with the floor. 

Blood and bones splattered everywhere.

A significant amount got splattered onto me but I was stunned, mentally and physically.

It was that moment, I realized...

Phanna is nothing like anything I know.

I don't know how much time has passed but I saw Phanna fall over and I quickly snapped back to reality and rushed over to Phanna's side.

"Phanna are you ok?" I shouted.

But Phanna didn't give me a proper responce

I placed my hand on Phanna's shoulder again and tried again.

"Phanna are you ok?!"

Phanna looked at me with eyes full of shock and pain and mouth wide open.

I didn't need an answer to know that Phanna was not ok. 

I could feel Phanna's shivers with the hand I had on their shoulder.

"Mikay, Ethan, this.. this.. all this is a simulation. you.. all of you.. you're all simulated.. I.. I created this whole world.. everyone.. I.. I.." Phanna muttered.

As Phanna spoke, I noticed that Ethan has arrived as well.

Multiple other teachers were around too and many more were trying to control the students and the examines.

I looked over to Ethan and he was also quite shocked by the events.

But my mind was only on Phanna.

"Ethan, c-check on how Phanna's doing!" I barked.

“B-but... I... I have to... I... I...“ 

"Ethan... I need you..."

"B-but... Melody... I... I... have to... check on... her"

Melody? she's already dead.

Why would you care about Melody.

Phanna's still alive and injured. 

Phanna needs youmore than Melody.

A torrent of thoughts and emotions raced across my mind yet for some reason, I didn't voice any of them.

Perhaps I already knew why, perhaps I knew Ethan's decision is correct.

But all I felt right now was betrayed.

I grabbed Phanna with both hands and started trying to wake Phanna up. 

"Phanna! Phanna! get a hold of yourself!" I shouted..

Instead, all I got were some comments about dreams or waking up.

"Phanna! Phanna! Wake up!" I shouted over and over again. 

But no response.

The last thing Phanna said was a plea to be saved.

After that, Phanna passed out. 

The only thing that kept me calm enough to function was the fact that Phanna was still breathing.

I placed my hand placed on Phanna's chest to monitor their breathing.

In a way, this was more for my sake than for Phanna's since it helped me stay calm knowing that Phanna's still alive.

I looked over to Ethan and Melody eagerly waiting for him to come over to check on Phanna.

I couldn't help but feel a bit saddened by both Melody and Ethan.

Ethan and I both knew that Melody was beyond saving.

Yet his duties as the cleric and as the principal of the school demands that he at least try to do something for Melody.

A fruitless struggle that must continue.

But Melody was the one who saddened me more.

Melody was so much like Ethan when I first tested him too.

Her drive to give 100% all the time, to keep pushing despite the odds.

I felt like I've failed her, not only her but also Ethan and the future of the school and the Mastery League and the northern mountain elven tribe...

I shoudn't have slowed down, I should have kept running, maybe I could have made it in time to save her.

Maybe I could have saved Phanna too if I had realized sooner.

Was this whole exam a mistake?

Was Phanna right all along and that coming to this exam was a mistake?

I don't have the answer but all I have now is my lingering regrets.

"M-Master Mikay, w-what should we do?" asked a teacher beside me interupting my thoughts.

I recognized her.

She was Emily, a teacher whom I used to teach with. 

She was probably the second in command here considering she had and probably still has 2 Innate Abilities to call her own.

Actually, I guess I'm technically the one who should be in charge here since I have 4 Innate Abilities and I was a former teacher.

That would make Emily third in command I guess.

I glanced down to Phanna laying on the ground beside me and then to the panicked students and even some panicked teachers.

Emily seemed like she was barely holding it together herself.

"Contact the Mastery League home base to inform them of the situation and ask for assistance and guidance. The long range communicator should be in the principal's office. Do you know what it looks like?"

Emily gave me a nod and ran off. 

As she did, Ethan stood up from next to Melody shaking his head.

I knew that he couldn't do anything for Melody at that point but he had to give it a shot anyways.

Amanda was nearby too and Ethan spoke to her quickly before coming to to Phanna's side.

"M-Master Mikay.. M-my apology.." Ethan said in a shaking voice as he started examining Phanna.

I wanted to complain to Ethan that he should have came sooner but I held back my words.

We both knew the proper procedure is to check on the most injuried examenees first despite both of us also knowing full well that Melody was beyond saving.

Without a nother word, Ethan began examining Phanna with his Soprano ability as I stood up to get out of the way.

I glanced at Ethan impatiently as he performed his the usual checkup routien. 

What normally would have been a brief moment felt like forever as I waited eagerly for the results of Phanna's checkup.

Finally, Ethan spoke up.

"I-I can't believe this... P-Phanna's completely unharmed..." Ethan stated in shock.

"Now's not the time to joke around!" I said in frustration.

"N-No I-I would never joke about something like this to you M-MasterMikay. B-But it's true, other than a bruse, Phanna's completely unharmed."

"Phanna received a Quicken empowered punch and kick to the head. How do you expect me to believe that they're completely unharmed?!"

"I... um... I... I really don't know... I checked over Phanna's whole body twice and I can't find anything other than a bruse..."

I was shocked. 

I knew Ethan had no reason to lie to me about this.

Especially with his reputation as a claric on theline.

He also seemed to be completely ernest in the way he's speaking.

Yet for some reason, I just can't bring myself to believe what he's saying.

Afterall, the type of attack that Phanna received would have killed any undefended person.

Even if Phanna was physically as strong and durable as a giant, there's no way they'd be completely unharmed by an attack like that. 

All the more so when taking into consideration that Phanna's fighting style is very similar to the common rabbitmen fighting style which suggest that Phanna's body must have rabbitmen like characteristics. 

"M-Maybe Phanna managed to defelct most of the attack?" Ethan said meekly as he tried to come up with an explanation for the rather unbelieveable situation.

"We both saw how what happened and we both know that that's impossiable." I said glacing at Ethan

I checked over Phanna myself trying to see if there's any external signs of injury and sure enough, there was nothing.

How is this possiable?

"M-master Mikay... I-if you'd like, I can use your Sphere of Influence to perform an examination on Phanna and show you what I can see..."

Without a second thought, I instantly snapped a reply.

"Do it."

Ethan was a bit startled by my snappy responce and but quickly regained his posture and began the process of controlling another person's Sphere of Influence.

"Permission for Influence Extention" Ethan chanted.

"Granted" I chanted in return.

As soon as those words left my mouth, an unfarmiliar feeling of losing controle over a part of myself washed over the area that normally would have been part of my Sphere of Influence.

"M-master Mikay, please place Phanna on the ground and place your hands over their body" Ethan requested.

I've seen Ethan perform the examination a couple times before so I had a pretty good idea what this position was supposed look like.

I quickly got Phanna and myself into position but without the assistance of Strengthen, this task became much harder than I was used to.

After getting into position, Ethan began performing the examination using my Sphere of Influence.

It was a very strange feeling to have someone else activate abilities that I did not have using my body.

Soon enough though, I was able to see inside of Phanna's body.

Phanna's bones were fuzzy at some parts but increadibly sharp in others just like ethan described during his first examination of Phanna.

Fortunately, Phanna's skull was not fuzzy unlike their arms and legs.

"Master Mikay, are you able to see?"

"Yes"

"Fortunately, Phanna's skull isn't the fuzzy kind of bones."

"Yah" I agreed.

"Master Mikay, as you can see, the left and right side of Phanna's head is completely the same indicating that there's no damage there..." 

I examined Ethan's claims as he spoke and it turns out what he said is completely true.

"And if you follow along the spine, you can see that there's no difference between the left and the right side of Phanna's bones. If Phanna sustained any damage to their bone structure, it should be very appearent but there's nothing that breaks the mirror patern of Phanna's left and right side..."

I continued to examine Phanna as much as I can with Ethan's assistance but it seems like everything that Ethan is saying is completely correct as he continued to explain.

"What gets a bit more difficult to examin is Phanna's organs. Since you don't have any reference to what Phanna's internals looks like, it's hard to explain what should or shouldn't look any particular way but you can clearly see Phanna breathing and their heartbeat here." Ethan said pointing towards Phanna's chest before continueing.

"However One that we can gather is that because Phanna's rib cage is undammaged, we can assume that anything protected by it is also undamaged and since Melody's attack hit Phanna's upper body we can assume that there's no damage to anything below the rib cage."

Ethan stopped explaining at this point to look at me.

I can see fully well that everything that he said is completely true. 

It really doesn't look like Phanna has taken any damage at all.

Seeing this with my eyes first hand gave me a sense of relief but also a strange feeling of discomfort not knowing exactly what or why.

"Thanks Ethan..." Was the only thing I could say at this point as I dropped myself back down onto the floor to sit next to Phanna.

Seeing me leaving the examination position, Ethan responsibly stopped his control of my Sphear of Influence.

"Terminate Influence Extention" Ethan whispered.

I felt my Sphere of Influence return to my controle but that wasn't where my mind was.

The only thing on my mind was Phanna.

I felt like I should be happy that phanna was well and appeared to be unharmed but that was something I didn't feel.

Why? What happened? How?

Questions kept flowing into my mind yet there were no answeres.

"M-master Mikay... M-May I be excused...?" Ethan asked meekly.

"Ah... Right... Thank you for your help. Please go and take care of the school... And also... Sorry about earlier.... you made the right choice to check on Melody first..."

I hate to admit it but Ethan did the right thing.

He gave me a slow nod and then retreated from my side.

What should I do now?

I wanted to take Phanna home immediately but as the highest ranking member of the Mastery League present, I technically have the responsibility to take charge during emergencies.

However, Ethan is the Principal of the school and has athority over his school not to mention that he's much more suited for leadership and administration than I am.

Afterall, other than cleanup and checking on the other students before sending them home, there really isn't anything else to do.

I guess the only thing I could do is to keep an eye of the area incase anyone wanted to use the uproar to cause trouble.

Following that line of logic, I re-activated 3 instances of Investigation and Observation each.

That was when I noticed that Emily and Ethan were making their way back to me.

They were carrying the long range communicator with them too.

"What's wrong" I asked upon their arrival.

"M-Master Mikay, home base would like to speak to you." Emily stuttered as she handed me the long range communicator.

"This is Master Mikay." I called out to the communicator that I received from Emily.

"Master Mikay, we will be needing your cooperation in an important mission regarding the recent death of an examenee." said the person on the other side of the communicator.

What? Isn't the only thing that's left to do cleanup and checking on the students? 

I didn't really know what was going on but I do know that I am obligated to help.

"Sure, what's the mission?" I replied.

"Since you have the largest Sphear of Influence in the area, we will be using your Sphear of Influence to observe the suroundings and then alter the memories of all those who have whitnessed the event."

"Y-You cant be serious? Is that even possiable?"

"Yes, absolutely. Now please keep a firm grip on the communicator. I will now begin Influence Extention. Permission for Influence Extention."

I was doubtful of what this person was suggesting but it is a direct communication from home base.

I didn't really have a good reason to refuse this request either.

"G-Granted..." I said reluctantly and as I did, the strange feeling of a part of my body leaving my control graced me yet again.
