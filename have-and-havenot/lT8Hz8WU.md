# Epilogue

"Master Mikay, thank you for your cooperation. I will now proceed to altering your... huh the communication ended suddenly..."

"Is everything alright?"

"I'm... not sure..."

"What happened?"

"For some reason, communication between me and Mikay suddenly stopped."

"That's... either unfortunate or really bad..."

"Sigh..."

"I guess I'll go assemble a team to investigate..."

"Yes please... Oh and also, make sure the investigation team has a combat ready Master or Grandmaster. Mikay is a combat focused Master so if it is an act of rebellion, things might get a bit messy."

"Of all the things the guy could be..."

"Well, that's just the worst case scenario. Judging from the way he spoke, it doesn't really feel like he's the type to rebel."

"I sure hope you're right and it's just a simple communication device malfunction."

"I do too..."

"So what about the rest of the people around?"

"Oh that, I've successfully managed to alter their memories. The only person left is Mikay."

"phew... I guess the most probable explanation is a device malfunction."

"I'm feeling that way too. Lets hope we're right."

"Me too. I really wish they made these things more reliable."

"I mean, the communicators are as reliable as they come."

"Well I know that much. But I still feel like they could be made better."

"Yaaa well. I'm just happy that we have these things to use at all."

"I guess... But I really wish the gods made them better so I wouldn't have to clean up messes like these so often."

"Right right... you can feel free to build your own communicator"

"... Whatever... I'll be heading off to clean up this mess now..."

"Thanks, and sorry."

"grumble grumble"
