# Memories

“So, what’s with the glass box? I was half expecting it to go away magically once I accepted your request,” said Phanna in that ever so familiar half-dead voice.

I gave Phanna a look of confusion as I asked.

“Why would the aquarium go away after you accepted my request?”

“This isn’t my homeworld so anything could happen. But being stuck in a glass box isn’t the most ideal way of interacting with this world. That’s why I thought this is some special tutorial condition I had to accept to begin interacting with this world”

“Tutorial? Know what, don’t even answer, any explanation you give is just gonna end up hurting my head. Anyways, the glass box is to keep you safe so just wait a bit. I’ll find a way to get you out.”

“safe?” Phanna asked curiously.

I sighed in response to Phanna’s question.

I didn’t know if I should tell Phanna the truth or not.

If I did, Phanna might end up resenting me but if Phanna can spot me lying then that might as well be the same result.

That said, I’m not even that good of a liar. I don’t think things through enough to cover my tracks well.

My lack of a plan for how to save my daughter after summoning a champion is proof of my lack of foresight.

As someone who cannot lie for my life, it’s probably best to just tell Phanna the truth right now.

But even then, it makes me a bit nervous about how Phanna would respond.

I took a deep breath and began explaining.

“The last person I summoned died shortly after being summoned due to an illness. When he died, he said something about vaccine or quarantine. I have no idea what those are but I thought I should summon you into an aquarium and maybe it’ll be able to protect you from the illness that the previous summon died to.”

I was nervous but I didn’t let it show.

Being able to hide fear or nervousness is a very important skill to have when faced with some difficult challenges.

Despite my nervousness, Phanna was silent and didn’t seem to notice.

I had considered giving up on the whole summoning plan a few times after my previous summoning ended up in failure.

If Phanna ends up resenting me because of this and decides to just abandon me then I’m not even sure what to do next.

I just stood there looking at Phanna with Pillow in my arms.

“Mikay, you don’t have to worry about that. I’m… a bit special I guess. I can’t find a better way of explaining it.”

As Phanna said these words, I felt a sense of relief wash over me.

I noticed my shoulder relax a bit but not by much as I replied with “I see.”

“Anyways, just let me out of this box. I want to hug that de-stressing toy in your arms right now.” 

“No no please, I’m sure you’re quite special but please just wait a bit longer. I’ll find a way to let you safely explore this world as much as you want.”

Phanna responded to my statement with an eye roll accompanied by a look of displeasure.

“I’m sorry Phanna. Please, I really can’t afford to lose you too…”

“You won’t. I’m pretty sure that I’m going to be just fine.” Phanna said while staring at me with a serious expression.

I returned phanna’s gaze and we stared at each other for a while.

…

…

“I can’t risk it… I’m sorry… Please just be patient for a bit. I will go find someone to help me get you out right now, alright? So please just wait for me.”

Phanna just sighed in response and started poking at the aquarium from the inside.

“Um, I’ll take that as a yes then?”

Still no response.

“Alright then, I’ll be back soon.”

And with those words, I left the room closing the door behind me.

Before I can leave my home and get the assistance of a healer to help with preventing or treat any illness that might happen, I’d needed to put Pillow in a place where it wouldn’t cause any trouble or eat things it shouldn’t.

To my knowledge, Pillow’s generally quite passive and well-behaved but according to house guests, Pillow’s prone to acting up and causing a ruckus.

In fact, the only times in my knowledge where Pillow has acted up in any way was when I had house guests over.

That was why I had Pillow on the lookout when I was summoning Phanna.

Pillow doesn’t act up every time but most of the time, it does.

That’s why I was hugging it the whole time while talking to Phanna as I was half expecting it to start acting up.

Pillow being calm in Phanna’s presence was definitely a pleasant surprise.

But despite that, I didn’t want to just let it roll around my home without my supervision since it would be lonely with an unfamiliar person around and no one to calm it down if it started acting up.

That’s why I walked across the hallway and entered a room labeled “Hickory”.

As I entered the room, I felt a sense of nostalgia wash over me.

This is the room of my daughter who left me years ago.

Everything within the room was kept the way they were on the day Hickory left.

The undone bed sheets, the random things on the table, even the clothing she keeps in her closet, and the half-open door of that closet.

All of it was kept in the same state as if they were waiting for their owner to return one day.

The only thing that’s different is a mini aquarium that I commissioned the other day as the larger one is currently being used as a safe space for Phanna.

I walked over to the table on the other side of the room.

I placed Pillow into the mini aquarium and closed the lid on it to keep Pillow from jumping out.

Of course, I didn’t intend to keep the aquarium here for long. It’s just that, for now, this is the only room in the house that I can put Pillow in during moments like this.

As soon as Phanna’s safe to move around, I’m gonna have the big aquarium refilled and put Pillow back inside of its main home.

I stood there for a while reminiscing about my memories of Hickory growing up as I put Pillow into the mini aquarium.

I ended up looking towards the drawer that Hickory also uses as a display stand.

Looking across the display, a torrent of memories of the time I spent fathering her came rushing forth to my mind.

The Mark of a Protege badge was placed to the left. She got it when she was just 12. Not the record for the youngest Protege, but definitely extraordinary.

Beside that, was the Mark of a Master badge she got when she was 14. I can still remember the day she got this and how excited she was being able to join me and Aurora in our future missions. The very next day, the three of us went on our first joint assignment together.

And besides, that… was a burnt-up item, what most would dismiss as trash but is something that bears heavily on my mind. It’s the Mark of a Grandmaster badge that formerly belonged to Hickory.

The day she earned it was bittersweet. She had long since qualified to advance to the rank of Grandmaster but she kept it a secret to stay with me and Aurora on joint assignments.

It was bittersweet for me too. I was happy that my daughter has surpassed me, but also sad over the fact that I’ll likely never reach those heights myself, and above all, was my motivation to join her in the highest rank.

But that didn’t happen…

I still remember the day she left me, she threw her Mark of a Grandmaster badge into a fire pit before walking away.

I distinctly remember her saying “This is not what’s right. This is not what the world needs.”

Ever since then, I had never been able to get any closer to her than the border of her territory.

Shaking myself out of my nostalgia, I turned around and brought myself through the door, carefully closing it behind me as to not disturb the contents inside.

I used to keep this door open but as time passed on, it became harder and harder to walk past this room without the feelings welling up within me.

That’s why nowadays, I have to keep this door closed.

Walking down the hallway, I came up to the main door leading outside.

I prepared myself for a quick walk to the edge of town.

I’m quite lucky to still be quite mobile even at this age.

I locked up the door and began the short walk to the mastery academy located at the edge of town; a place where I once taught.

Hopefully, I won’t be too much of a bother showing up out of the blue like this.

<!-- <img src="~" width="600" height="250" alt="(Image: The point of view is from high above with a bird's eye view of the area. There's an L shaped building with two arms seemingly of equal length.

There's three towers that stick out of the building one on each end of the arms and a taller and thicker one at the intersection of the 2 arms of the building.)"/> -->

After a short walk, I found myself closing in on the back entrance of the building.

I could hear the teachers and the students doing their outdoor exercises and drills on the field in front of the building on the other side of my current position.

Before proceeding any further I began making observations of the abilities that are currently active within the building.

Unsurprisingly, the field on the other side of the building is where most of the active abilities are located.

From the looks of it, the class was doing some sort of ability training drill or the likes.

That or it could be combat practice, but those are rather rare so it’s more likely to be activities that help the students get used to using, maintaining, and moving with an ability or abilities in an active state.

Secondary to that were the classrooms where the teachers were lecturing to large groups of students and graduates performing experiments.

The lecturers seem to be using an ability to amplify their voice and the experimenters are using observational abilities.

I didn’t know what’s happening but that was what I would guess based on the location of these activations and the types of abilities that are currently active.

After a while, my suspicions are all but confirmed.

It looks like there are only 2 large area observation abilities active. Both are on the field in front of the school.

I activated my sound reduction ability and my Camouflage ability as I began making my way into the school ground.

Infiltrating a school in broad daylight is strangely easier than some of my previous infiltration assignments despite those assignments being conducted in the middle of the night.

Well, me being fully aware of the exact interior of this building made this infiltration significantly easier. After all, I was a teacher here for quite some time before.

It wasn’t long before I arrived at the principal's office where the current principal is currently buried under a pile of paperwork… Figuratively.

Of course, the door isn’t locked or closed as dictated by tradition.

The principal needs to be easily accessible at all times in case of an emergency, or so the logic goes.

I stealthily made my way into the room with my 2 abilities active and just stood there to observe the principal.

Since the camouflage ability doesn’t fully make me invisible but rather, translucent, it isn’t really the perfect tool to keep out of sight.

But it gets the job done, though, as a side effect everything in my field of vision seemed to get a little darker.

I’m sure the principal would notice me standing around sooner or later.

As if right on queue, the principal lifted his head towards me and the emotionless expression on his face quickly gave way to shock as he noticed my presence.

“Master Mikay?! You should have told me you were coming, I would have prepared…”

“No no principal Ethan, the last time you ‘prepared’ for my arrival, you turned a mundane visit into a festival,” I replied as I deactivated my abilities.

“Well, that’s because…”

I can sense Ethan trying to think up an excuse but really, he’s just a fan of me I guess.

“Anyways, I’m just passing by to ask you a couple of favors.”

“Anything for you Master Mikay.”

“No need to be like that Ethan. After all, you too are a full-fledged Master now.”

“But I couldn’t have done it without you! So what can I do for you this time? Has your summoning succeeded?”

“Hmm? How’d you know?”

“You seem more relaxed than usual.”

“I’m surprised you noticed. I had just finished summoning another champion who has agreed to help me on my quest.”

“That’s amazing news Master Mikay!… So… did you manage to get a name from your new champion this time around?”

“Phanna, that’s the name of my current champion,” I said as I held up a fist in bittersweet victory.

“Oh, it’s a good thing that you managed to get your champion’s name and assistance without much trouble!”

“If only it was as easy as what you’re imagining right now.”

Ethan looked rather confused about my prior statement so I began explaining.

“Apparently, Phanna’s homeworld doesn’t use names, and instead, uses numbers to address each other.”

“That’s rather unbelievable.”

“Tell me about it. Not only that, Phanna didn’t even fully agree to assist me with saving Hickory.”

“Is that even possible? I thought the summoning ritual only calls forth those who are willing to help.” Ethan questioned.

“Well, Phanna didn’t reject me either. I was told that I’d need a concrete plan first or something.”

“Hmmm… That’s rather odd.”

“You think so too?” I asked.

“In all the books I’ve read, the summoned champions are always full of energy and ready to get things done and often immediately take up action.”

“Glad it wasn’t just my imagination then…”

Hearing that from Ethan helped confirm my suspicion.

I didn’t want to think that Phanna’s summoning was abnormal somehow.

But, if Ethan also thinks that something’s weird then there’s no doubt about it; something’s definitely strange with Phanna’s summoning.

Ethan is one of the more knowledgeable masters I know. That means I consider his opinion trustworthy.

At least in non-personal matters…

I noticed myself letting out a sigh as Ethan nods in agreement with my observation.

“I guess that also means that the other requirement I applied to the summoning should be double-checked as well”

“Oh, right! What other requirements did you apply?” Ethan asked while giving me a look of admiration.

“Just the requirement of being a capable fighter.”

“Did you apply any other requirements outside of the standard set?” Ethan asked again as if expecting something.

I know exactly what Ethan wanted to hear, which is why I had a pretty solid idea of how Ethan is going to feel about my response.

“I think I only used the standard set. First, capable of communicating with me, second, willing to assist me, and third, capable in a fight.”

“Is that all? Those conditions all seem to be rather ordinary summoning requirements.”

“Sorry to have disappointed you I guess.”

“No no, I wasn’t disappointed at all. I just thought that a Master of your skill level would surely make more than just the basic set of requirements during the summoning.”

“I did consider applying more conditions but with each additional requirement, the time it takes for a Champion to be summoned is increased and the odds of failure are also increased. Not only that, I didn’t even know what additional requirement I should have applied. You see this is all a matter of managing risks.”

“I-I see…”

Ethan’s expression changed making it apparent that he has realized something.

Maybe he realized the flaw in his thinking or maybe he realized something else.

Whatever it was, the fact that Ethan realized something was painfully obvious.

Then again, Ethan wasn’t the front-line type.

It’s no surprise that Ethan wears his emotions on his face.

“So, Master Mikay, how do you plan to check on Phanna’s combat competency?”

I thought about Ethan’s question but I didn’t have an answer and so, I gave Ethan a shrug.

Ethan seemed to be surprised by my response.

I mean, I was never a good planner, I had no idea where Ethan’s confidence in me stems from.

But Ethan stopped being surprised quickly after his initial reaction.

“How about having Phanna participate in the upcoming entrance exams. A new semester is starting in just a bit over a month which means the entrance exams for the new semester will be held in just under two weeks.”

Ethan’s suggestion caught me by surprise.

“It seems like a rather good suggestion.” I thought out loud.

However, I just can’t shake the feeling that there’s some sort of an ulterior motive behind this suggestion.

“I know right, Master Mikay! And besides, the entrance exams are safe as the faculty here is very careful about intervening before things get too mucky. Not only that, the examinees are discouraged from using lethal force. It’s the perfect time to check how good Phanna is in combat!”

“Well… you do make a very convincing argument… But I feel like that might be asking a bit too much of you. Besides, Phanna hasn’t even completed any of the pre-examination work.”

“No no, don’t worry about that, I am happy to waive Phanna’s examination qualification requirement! And besides… it’d be a great honor for our school to host you as part of our judging committee.”

It was at this moment that I realized what Ethan wanted: to have me on the judging committee.

This was something I haven’t done ever since my retirement from being a member of this school’s faculty.

While I was teaching here, I wasn’t exactly as celebrated as I am now.

At the time, I was only an exceptionally powerful instructor as a Level 4 Master with 3 Innate Abilities when most other instructors were Level 2 to 3 Protege with 1 to 2 Innate Abilities. But that was it.

In fact, I still don’t quite understand how I became the celebrity that I am now.

I didn’t know what to do.

I feel like I had no choice but to agree with Ethan’s suggestion.

But I also have a bad feeling about how things will turn out if I were to show up on the judging committee.

I wanted to ask if I can just observe the events without having to judge them but knowing the situation, that might not be the best thing to ask.

After all, despite not knowing how I got my celebrity status, I really would like to keep it.

“I… Um… Well, I guess I’d also be honored to participate in the selection of the Mastery League’s next-generation one last time.”

“Glad to have you onboard Master Mikay!”

Ethan gave me an incredibly big smile but all I felt was a bit ambiguous about this whole situation.

The bell on the bell tower of the building ringed indicating that it’s now 4 pm just as I thought this.

Footstep sounds began echoing throughout the hallways as many students eagerly began making their way off the campus grounds.

I let out a sigh and attempted to change the topic before this whole thing gets derailed anymore.

“Ethan, do you think you can come to pay me a visit sometime soon?”

Ethan was a bit surprised and caught off guard by my remark.

“O-of course! I shall depart immediately!”

“Don’t you have principal duties to perform?”

“That’s not an issue I can always delegate. And besides, how can I turn down a request by The Master Mikay himself?”

I didn’t like his response.

It made me feel uncomfortable like I was interrupting something. Or maybe it’s the feeling of Ethan being undutiful.

“Uhh, I appreciate the kind gesture but I also need to prepare as well. Do you think you can come over later when you have the time instead?”

“Then how does tonight after dinner sound?” replied Ethan with much energy and excitement.

“Yeah, that will work. I’ll be on my way now, see you later tonight.”

The footsteps outside in the hallway were now getting more aggressive as the students continued to pack up their belongings and make their way out of the school building.

Having mostly achieved what I came here for, I took this chance to exit Ethan’s office blending into the crowds just outside the hallway as Ethan gave me a nod.

As I did, I was barely able to catch Ethan calling “Ah! See you later!” from his office.

If I didn’t end it forcefully, he would have easily able to keep me in an unending conversation for hours.

That said, I do get the feeling that Ethan probably knows this too as he doesn’t seem too bothered by my departure.
