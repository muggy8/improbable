# Memories

"So what's with the glass box? I was half expecting it to go away somehow once I accepted your request." said Phanna in that ever so familiar half dead voice. 

I gave Phanna a look of confusion as I asked.

"Why would the aquarium go away after you accept my request?"

"This isn't my home world so anything could happen. But being stuck in a glass box isn't really the most ideal way of interacting with this world so I thought this is some special tutorial condition I had to go through to actually begin interacting with this world"

"Tutorial? Know what don't even answer, any explanation you give is just gonna end up hurting my head. Anyways, the glass box is to keep you safe so just wait a bit. I'll find a way to get you out."

"safe?" Phanna asked curiously.

I sighed in response to Phanna's question. 

I didn't know if I should tell Phanna the truth or not.

If I did, Phanna might end up resenting me but if Phanna is able to spot me lying then that might as well be the same result.

that said, I'm not even that good of a lyer. I don't think things through enough to cover my tracks well. 

My lack of a plan for how to save my daughter after summoning a champion is the proof of my lack of foresight.

As someone who cant really lie for my life, It's probably best to just tell Phanna the truth right now.

But even then, it makes me a bit nervious about how Phanna would respond.

I took a deep breath and began explaining.

"The last person I summoned died shortly after being summoned due to an Illness. When he died, he said something about Vaccine or Quarinteen. I have no idea what those are but I thought I should summon you into an aquarium and maybe it'll be able to protect you from the illness that the pervious summon died to."

I was nervous but I didn't let it show. 

Being able to hide fear or nerviousnes is a very important skill to have when faced with some difficult challenges. 

But despite that, I know I was nervous but Phanna was silent and didn't seem to notice.

I had considered giving up on the whole summoning plan a few times after my previous summoning ended in failure. 

If Phanna ends up resenting me because of this and decides to just abandon me then I'm not even sure what to do next.

I just stood there looking at Phanna with Pillow in arm.

"Mikay, you don't have to worry about that. I'm... a bit special I guess. I can't really find a better way of explaining it."

As Phanna said these words, I felt a sense of relief wash over me. 

I noticed my sholder relax a bit but not by much as I replied with "I see."

"Anyways, just let me out of this box. I want to hug that de-stressing toy in your arms right now."

"No no please, I'm sure you're quite special but please just wait a bit longer. I'll find a way to let you safely explore this world as much as you want."

Phanna responded to my statement with an eye roll accompinied by a look of displeasure. 

"I'm sorry Phanna. Please, I really can't afford to lose you too..."

"You won't. I'm pretty sure that I'm going to be just fine." Phanna said while staring at me with a serious expression.

I returned phanna's gaze and we stared at each for a while.

...

...

"I can't risk it... I'm sorry... Please just be patient for a bit. I will go find someone to help with getting you out right now alright? So please just wait for me."

Phanna just sighed in response and started poking at the aquarium from the inside.

"Um, I'll take that as a yes then?"

Still no responce.

"Alright then, I'll be back soon."

And with those words, I left the room closing the door behind me.

Before I can leave my home and get the assistance of a clerk to help with preventing or treat any illness that might happen, I'd needed to put Pillow in a place where it wouldn't cause any trouble or eat things it shouldn't.

To my knowledge, Pillow's generally quite passive and well-behaved but according to house guests, Pillow's prone to acting up and causing a ruckus. 

In fact, the only times in my knowledge where Pillow has acted up in any way was when I had house guests over. 

That was why I had Pillow on lookout when I was summoning Phanna.

Pillow doesn't act up every time but most of the time, it does.

That's way I was hugging it the whole time while talking to Phanna as I was half expecting in to start acting up.

Pillow being calm in Phanna's presence was definitely a present surprise in however.

But despite that, I didn't want to just let it roll around my home without me around since it would be alone with an unfamiliar person and no one to calm it down if it started acting up.

That's why I walked across the hall way and entered a room labeled "Hickory".

On the far side of the room is a table with some stuff on it and a chair in front of it. By the right wall is a bed and by the left wall is a drawer with more stuff on it. A large mirror is to the left of the drawer and a window to the right)"/>

As I entered the room, I felt a sense of nostalgia wash over me.

This is the room of my daughter who left me years ago.

Everything within the room was kept the way they were on the day Hickory left.

The undone bed sheets, the random things on the table, even the clothing she keeps in her closet and the half open door of said closet.

All of it was kept in the same state as if they were waiting for their owner to return one day.

The only thing that's different is a mini aquarium that I commissioned the other day as the larger one is currently being used as a safe space for Phanna.

I walked over to the table on the other side of the room.

I placed Pillow into the mini aquarium and closed the lid on it to keep Pillow from jumping out.

Of course I didn't intend to keep the aquarium here for long. It's just that, for now, this is the only room in the house that I can put pillow in during moments like this.

As soon as Phanna's safe to move around, I'm gonna have the aquarium refilled and put Pillow back inside of it's main home.

I stood there for a while reminiscing about my memories of Hickory growing up as I put Pillow into the mini aquarium.

I ended up looking towards the drawer that Hickory often uses as a display stand in addition to keeping her clothing in.

Looking across the display, a torrent of memories of the time I spent fathering her came rushing forth to my mind.

The Mark of a Protege badge was placed to the left. She got it when she was just 12. Not the record for the youngest Protege but definitely extraordinary.

Beside that was the Mark of a Master badge she got when she was 14. I can still remember the day she got this and how excited she was to be able to be around me and Fiona more in the coming days. The very next day, the three of us went on our first joint assignment together.

And beside that... a burnt up item, what most would dismiss as trash but is something that bears heavy on my mind. It's The Mark of a Grandmaster badge that formerly belonged to Hickory.

The day she earned it was bittersweet. She had long since qualified to advance to the rank of Grandmaster but she kept it a secret to stay with me and Fiona on joint assignments.

It was also bittersweet for me too. happy that my daughter has surpassed me, sad that I'll likely never reach those heights myself and above all, the motivation to join her in the highest rank.

But that didn't happen...

I still remember the day she left me, she threw her Mark of a Grandmaster badge into a fire pit before walking away.

I distinctly remember her saying "This is not what's right. This is not what the world needs."

Ever since, I had never been able to get any closer to her than the border of her territory.

Shaking myself out of my nostalgia, I turned around and brought myself through the door and closed it behind me carefully in order to not disturb the contents inside.

I used to keep this door open but as time passed on, it became harder and harder to walk past this room without the feelings welling up within me.

That's why nowadays, I have to keep this door closed.

Walking down the hallway, I came up to the main door leading outside.

I prepared myself for a quick walk to the town's center.

I'm quite lucky to still be quite mobile even at this age.

I locked up the door and began the short walk to the mastery academy located at the center of town; a place I once was a teacher at.

Hopefully I won't be too much of a bother showing up out of the blue like this.

<img src="~" width="600" height="250" alt="(Image: The point of view is from high above with a bird's eye view of the area. There's an L shaped building with two arms seemingly of equal length. There's a large gravel field that borders the two arms of the large L shaped building. There's three towers that stick out of the building one on each end of the arms and a taller and thicker one at the intersection of the 2 arms of the building.)"/>

After a short walk, I found myself closing in on the back entrance of the building.

I could hear the teachers and the students doing their outdoor exercises and drills on the field in front of the building on the other side of where I was currently standing.

Before proceeding any further I began making observations of the abilities that are currently active within the building.

Unsurprisingly, the field on the other side of the building had the most active abilities.

From the looks of it, the class was doing some sort of ability training drill or the likes.

That or it could be combat practice but those are rather rare so more likely it's activities that help the students get used to using, maintaining and moving with an ability or abilities active.

Secondary to that were the class rooms where the teachers were lecturing to large groups of students and graduates performing experiments.

The lecturers seem to be using an ability to amplify their voice and the experimenters are using observational abilities.

I didn't actually know what's happening but that was what I would guess was happening based on the location of these activations and the types of abilities that are currently active.

After a while, my suspicions are all but confirmed.

It looks like there's only 2 large area observation abilities active. Both on the field in front of the school.

I activated my sound reduction ability and my camouflage ability as I began making my way into the school ground.

Infiltrating a school in broad daylight is strangely easier than some of my previous infiltration assignments despite those assignments being conducted in the middle of the night.

Well, being someone who was fully aware of exactly what the interior of this building is like definitely made this infiltration easier. After all, I was a teacher here for quite some time before.

It wasn't long before I arrived at the principals office where the current principal is currently buried under a pile of paperwork... Figuratively.

Of course the door isn't locked or closed as dictated by tradition.

The principal needs to be easily accessible at all times in case of an emergency, or so the logic goes.

I stealthily made my way into the room with my 2 abilities active still and just stood there to observe the principle.

Since the camouflage ability doesn't fully make me invisible but rather, translucent it isn't really the perfect tool to keep out of sight.

But it gets the job done, though, as a side effect everything seems to get a little darker.

I'm sure the principal would notice me standing around sooner or later.

As if right on queue, the principal lifted his head to wards me and the emotionless expression on his face quickly gave way to shock as he noticed my presence.

"Master Mikay?! You should have told me you were coming, I would have prepared..."

"No no principal Ethan, the last time you 'prepared' for my arrival, you turned a mundane visit into a festival." I replied as I deactivated my abilities.

"Well that's because..."

I can sense Ethan trying to think up an excuse but really, he's just a fan of me I guess.

"Anyways, I'm really just passing by to ask you a couple favors"

"Anything for you Master Mikay"

"No need to be like that Ethan. After all, you too are a full fledged Master now."

"But I couldn't have done it without you! So what can I do for you this time? Has your summoning succeeded?"

"Hmm? How'd you know?"

"You seem more relaxed than usual"

"I'm surprised you noticed. I had just finished summoning another champion who has agreed to help me on my quest."

"That's amazing news Master Mikay!... So... did you manage to get a name from this champion?"

"Phanna, that's the name of my current champion" I said holding up a fist.

"Oh, it's a good thing that you managed to get your champion's name and assistance without much trouble!"

"If only it was as easy as what you're immagining right now."

Ethan looked rather confused about my prior statement so I began explaing. 

"Apparently, Phanna's home world doesn't use names and instead, uses numbers to address each other"

"That's rather unbelievable."

"Tell me about it. Not only that, Phanna didn't even fully agree to assist me with saving Hickory."

"Is that even possible? I thought the summoning ritual only calls forth those who are willing to help." Ethan questioned. 

"Well, Phanna didn't reject me either. Just that I needed a concrete plan or something."

"Hmmm... That's rather odd."

"You think so too?" I asked.

"In all the books I've read, the summoned champions are always full of energy ready to get things done and often immediately takes up actions."

"Glad it wasn't just my imagination then..."

Hearing that from Ethan helped confirm my suspicition. 

I didn't want to think that Phanna's summoning was abnormal somehow. 

But, if Ethan also thinks that something's weird then there's no doubt about it; something's definitely strange with Phanna's summoning. 

Ethan's one of the more knowledgeable master's I know so I definitely consider his opnion trustworthy.

At least in non-personal matters...

I noticed myself letting out a sigh as Ethan agreed to my observation with a nod.

"I guess that also means that the other requirement I applied to the summoning should be double-checked as well" 

"Oh right! What other requirements did you apply?" Ethan asked while gaving me a look of admiration.

"Just the requirement of being a capable fighter."

"Did you apply any other requirements outside of the standard set?" Ethan asked again as if expecting something.

I know exactly what Ethan wanted to hear, which is why I had a pretty solid idea of how Ethan is going to feel about my response.

"I think I only used the standard set. First, capable of communicating with me, second, willing to assist me, and third, capable in a fight."

"Is that all? Those conditions all seem to be rather ordinary summoning requirements."

"Sorry to have dissapointed you I guess."

"No no, I wasn't dissapointed at all. I just thought that a Master of your skill level would surely make moe than the basic set requirements during the summoning."

"I did consider applying moer conditions but with each additional requirement, the time it takes for a Champion to be summoned is increased and the odds of failure is also increased. Not only that, I didn't even know what additional requirement I should have applied. You see this is all a matter of managing risks"

"I-I see..."

Ethan's expression changed making it apparent that he has realized something.

Maybe he realized the flaw in his thinking or maybe he realized something else.

Whatever it was, the fact that Ethan realized something was painfully obvious.

Then again, Ethan wasn't really the front line type.

It's no surprise that Ethan wears his emotions on his face.

"So, Master Mikay, how do you plan to check on Phanna's combat compitiancy?"

I thought about Ethan's question but I didn't really have one and gave Ethan a shrug.

Ethan seemed to be surprised by my response.

I mean, I was never a good planner, I had no idea where Ethan's confidence in me came from.

But Ethan stopped being surprised about as quickly as ethan became supprised.

"How about having Phanna participate in the upcoming entrance exams. A new semester is starting in a just a bit over a mounth so which means that the entrence exams for the new semester will be held in just under two weeks time."

Ethan's suggestion caught me by supprise. 

"It seems like a rather good suggestion." I thought out loud.

However I  just can't shake the feeling that there's some sort of alterior motive behind this suggestion. 

"I know right, Master Mikay! And besides, the entrence exams are really safe as the faculty hear is very careful about interviening before things gets too mucky. Not only that, the examinees are discouraged from usign lethal force. It's the perfect time to check how good Phanna is in combat!"

"Well... you do make a very convincing argument... But I feel like that might be asking a bit too much of you. Besides, Phanna hasn't even completed any of the pre-examination work."

"No no, don't worry about that, I am happy to wave Phanna's examination qualification requirement! And besides… it'd be a great honor for our school to host you as part of our judging committee." 

It was at this moment that I realized what Ethan wanted: to have me on the judging committee.

This was something I haven't done ever since my retirement from being a member of this school's faculty.

While I was teaching here, I wasn't exactly as celebrated as I am now.

At the time, I was only an exceptionally powerful instructor as a Level 4 Master with 3 Innate Abilities when most other instructors were Level 2 to 3 Protege with 1 to 2 Innate Abilities. But that was it.

In fact, I still don't quite understand how I became the celebrity that I am now.

I didn't know what to do. 

I feel like I had no choice but to agree to Ethan's suggestion.

But I also have a bad feeling about how things will turn out if I were to show up on the judging committee.

I wanted to ask if I can just observe the events without having to judge it but knowing the situation, that might not be the best of asks.

"I... Um... Well, I guess I'd also be honored to participate in the selection of the Mastery League's next generation one last time."

"Glad to have you on board Master Mikay!"

Ethan gave me an incredibly big smile but all I felt was a bit ambiguous about this whole situation.

The bell on the bell tower of the buildind ringed as I thought this indicating that it's now 4pm.

Foot step sounds began echoing throughout the hallways as the many students eagerly began making their way off of the campus grounds.

I let out a sigh and attempted to change the topic before this whole thing gets derailed anymore.

"Ethan, do you think you can come pay me a visit some time soon?"

Ethan was a bie surprised and caught off guard by my remark.

"O-of course! I shall depart immediately!"

"Don't you have principal duties to perform?"

"That's not an issue I can always deligate. And besides, how can I turn down a request by The Master Mikay himself?"

I didn't like his responce. 

It made me feel uncomfortable, like I was interupting something.
 
"Uhh, I appreciate the kind gesture but I also need to prepair as well. Do you think you can come over later when you have time instead?"

"Then how does later tonight after dinner sound?" Replied Ethan with much energy and excitement.

"Yah, that'd work. I'll be on my way now, see you later tonight."

The foot steps outside in the hallway was now getting more aggressive as the students continued to pack up their belongings and make their way out of the school building.

Having mostly achieved what I came here for, I took this chance to exit Ethan's office blending into the crowds just outside in the hallway as Ethan gave me a nod.

As I did, I was barely able to catch Ethan calling "See you later!" from his office.

It might have seemed rather rude to just disappear on him, but given my past interactions with him, if I did end it forcefully, he would have easily be keep me in a conversation for hours on end.

That's why now a days, whenever I need to talk to him, I would have to sneak up on him as well as leave as soon as I can.

That said, I still try to let him engage in some chatter in order to maintain good will. 

Infact, I would say our chat about Phanna's summoning conditions was just that in action.

That said, I do get the feeling that Ethan probably knows this too as he doesn't seem too bothered with my disappearing act.
