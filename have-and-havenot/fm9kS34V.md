# After

Without another word, Phanna took off from my side as if they had Quicken active yet I knew that that wasn't the case.

I wanted to chase after them yet I couldn't.

I was broken, too broken.

I was asked a bunch of questions and yelled at in various ways and with words I could hardly understand, and now, I was all alone again.

Behind me felt like a nightmare that I didn't want to turn my head towards.

In front of me was my only hope for salvation fleeing from my sight.

I collapsed onto the floor unsure of anything anymore.

Were did it go wrong?

What did I do wrong?

I wanted to go home and forget all this.

I wanted to give up.

What's the point in trying if the odds of success is so small.

Phanna was my second summon and I can say for sure that this is probably the end of our cooperation.

I could summon 2 maybe 3 more, but would that even be worth it?

What should I do...

I sat there and lamented my situation for who knows how long.

I had no idea how much time had passed but Ethan's panicked voice behind me snapped me out of my daze.

I turned my head towards the school to find Ethan panicked looking around.

This brought little relief to my heart seeing him back on his feet.

He seemed to have noticed me as just as fast as well and quickly came to me.

"Thank goodness you're alright Master Mikay!" he exclaimed.

"I... Um"...

"I didn't expect that bandits would even consider raiding us in the middle of an exam no less. Thank goodness that you were here!"

"Wha..."

Before I finished I remembered that everyone's memories were altered.

"O-Oh right. Ah ha no problem. Just... um... doing my job..."

"No really! It's all thanks to you. There were 3 Protégé level attackers among the bandits! We would have suffered much greater casualties if it wasn't for you!"

"No no, It's really not that big of a deal..." I pleaded

"Modest as always I see! Take some credit Master Mikay! You are invaluable to our village!" Ethan laughed.

But I didn't really feel the way he did.

After all, I had just lost someone incredibly important to me.

"Do you think you can handle the rest of this from here Ethan?" I asked.

Ethan didn't answer immediately but instead looked at me with concern.

"A-Are you ok Master Mikay?"

"I... I don't know... I'd like to go home and rest"

I knew the truth.

There wasn't a fight at all, I was completely uninjured.

But I was exhausted, emotionally and mentally.

I didn't want to deal with any of this anymore.

I just wanted to go home and rest.

I'm sure I'll eventually find my resolve to try yet another summoning but right now, I didn't want to do anything.

"I... I understand Master Mikay... I'll take care of things from here. Please get some rest and take care of yourself." Ethan answered.

"Thanks Ethan" I murmured in response as I turned around and left the school grounds.

## <center>...</center>

The following days after the exam didn't go by easy.

I tried my best to look for Phanna but, as I expected, they were nowhere to be found.

There's a pretty high chance that Phanna has already left the Mountainpass area.

But judging from how Phanna moved around the school campus on the exam day, Phanna being able to evade my detection is not impossible as well.

The only thing I have left of Phanna's is the strange clothing that they were wearing.

I wasn't exactly sure what to do with them but I had a feeling that if I were to ever meet Phanna again, I should at least return those clothing.

I felt bad that I now held the only thing Phanna has left of their old life before I summoned them.

However, what shattered my spirit the most was the fact that I now have failed two whole summonings.

I didn't know what to do now.

To perform another summoning would mean to permanently give up a portion of my Influence.

Yet continuing my attempts to summon more champions feels like the most likely path to success for me.

But will it really be though?

There's also the chance that I could become stronger and maybe one day face her myself.

Yet there's no telling if that's possible either.

I didn't know what the right choice was and I definitely didn't want to make the wrong one.

I have made too many wrong decisions already and there's no longer any room for more mistakes.

...

Should I maybe just accept this fate that has befallen my family?

Is this karma giving me punishment for the mistakes I have made in my past?

I didn't know. I wanted to know. Even though I know that this isn't something that I could ever know.
