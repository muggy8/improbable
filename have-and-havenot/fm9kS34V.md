# Turmoil

Without another word, Phanna took off from my side as if they had Quicken active yet I knew that that wasn't the case.

I wanted to chase after them, yet I couldn't.

I was broken, too broken.

I was asked a bunch of questions and yelled at in various ways and with sounds that vaguely sounded like words, and now, I was all alone again.

Behind me felt like a nightmare that I didn't want to turn my head towards.

In front of me was my only hope for salvation fleeing from my sight.

I collapsed onto the floor unsure of anything anymore.

Were did it go wrong?

What did I do wrong?

I wanted to go home and forget all this.

I wanted to give up.

What's the point in trying if the odds of success is so small.

Phanna was my second summon and I can say for sure that this is probably the end of our cooperation.

I could summon 2 maybe 3 more, but would that even be worth it?

What should I do...

I sat there and lamented my situation for who knows how long.

I had no idea how much time had passed but Ethan's panicked voice behind me snapped me out of my daze.

I turned my head towards the school to find a panicked Ethan looking around.

This brought little relief to my heart seeing him back on his feet.

He seemed to have noticed me just as fast as well and quickly came to my side.

"Thank goodness you're alright Master Mikay!" he exclaimed.

"I... Um"...

"I didn't expect that another tribe would even consider raiding us, and in the middle of an exam no less. Thank goodness that you were here!"

"Wha..."

Before I finished I remembered that everyone's memories were altered.

"O-Oh right. Ah ha no problem. Just... um... doing my job..."

"No really! It's all thanks to you. There were 3 Protégé level attackers among the bandits! We would have suffered much more casualties if it wasn't for you!"

"No no, It's really not that big of a deal..." I pleaded

"Modest as always I see! Take some credit Master Mikay! You are invaluable to our village!" Ethan laughed.

But I didn't really feel the way he did.

After all, I had just lost someone incredibly important to me.

"Do you think you can handle the rest of this from here Ethan?" I asked.

Ethan didn't answer immediately but instead looked at me with concern.

"A-Are you ok Master Mikay?"

"I... I don't know... I'd like to go home and rest"

I knew the truth.

There wasn't a fight at all, I was completely uninjured.

But I was exhausted, emotionally and mentally.

I didn't want to deal with any of this anymore.

I just wanted to go home and rest.

I'm sure I'll eventually find my resolve to try yet another summoning but right now, I didn't want to do anything.

"I... I understand Master Mikay... I'll take care of things from here. Please get some rest and take care of yourself." Ethan answered.

"Thanks Ethan" I murmured in response as I turned around and left the school grounds.

The following days after the exam didn't go by easy.

I tried my best to find Phanna but, as I expected, they were no where to be found.

There's a pretty high chance that Phanna has already left the Mountainpass area.

But judging from how Phanna moved around the school campus on the exam day, Phanna being able to evade my detection is also a possibility.

The only thing I have left of Phanna's is the strange clothing that they were wearing.

I wasn't exactly sure what to do with them but I felt like it was my duty to keep them in decent condition since if I were to ever meet Phanna again, I could at least return those clothing.

These clothes were likely the only thing Phanna has left in this world that had a connection to their old life before I summoned them.

However, what truly shattered my spirit the most was the fact that I now have failed two whole summonings.

I didn't know what to do now.

To perform another summoning would mean to permanently give up yet another portion of my Influence.

Yet, continuing to summon champions feels like the most likely path to success.

But is it really though?

There's also the chance that I could become stronger and maybe one day, I could face Hickory myself.

Yet there's no telling if that's possible or how long it would take either.

I didn't know what the right choice was and I definitely didn't want to make the wrong one.

I have made too many wrong decisions already and there's no longer any room for more mistakes.

...

Should I maybe just accept this fate that has befallen my family?

Is this karma giving me punishment for the mistakes I have made in my past?

I didn't know. I wanted to know. Even though I know that this isn't something that I could ever know.

The most logical decision is to just perform one last summon. If that fails then I should probably conserve my Influence and attempt to get stronger to face Hickory one day...

But will I even have the energy or motivation to keep going with that plan after a third failure?

What Phanna said to me in our first conversation echoed in my mind: "What's your plan?"

I didn't know the answer to that question.

Thinking back, Phanna was probably correct.

Without a plan, it makes sense that I can't hope for too much...

Maybe I should summon someone who can help me with a planning out the next steps?

But that thought made me feel even more uneasy about my chances of success.

The more I thought about it, the more it felt like the right choice is just to accept the fate that has befallen my family.

What have I always done when these hard decisions came up in the past?

I tried to think.

Yet nothing came to me.

I combed through my memories and still nothing.

The only thing I could remember was the night I lost everything.

But looking back, the right choice was obvious. I should have fled.

But i didn't.

I gave up on that night.

That was my choice, a wrong choice.

Yet, I'm still here today.

Why was I spared?

I didn't know.

Does that mean fate itself wants me to fight against what's yet to happen?

Would that mean the right decision is to make the most logical decision?

What If I fail again?

These thoughts flowed in and out of my mind.

I was frozen by the decisions ahead.

Yet somewhere in the back of my mind, I knew that my time was finite and I couldn't afford to be indecisive.
