# Turmoil

Without another word, Phanna took off from my side as if they had Quicken active yet I knew that that wasn't the case.

I wanted to chase after them, yet I couldn't.

I was broken, too broken.

I was asked a bunch of questions and yelled at in various ways and with sounds that vaguely sounded like words, and now, I was all alone again.

Behind me felt like a nightmare that I didn't want to turn my head towards.

In front of me was my only hope for salvation fleeing from my sight.

I collapsed onto the floor unsure of anything anymore.

Where did it go wrong?

What did I do wrong?

I wanted to go home and forget all this.

I wanted to give up.

What's the point in trying if the odds of success are so small.

Phanna was my second summon and I can say for sure that this is probably the end of our cooperation.

I could summon 2 maybe 3 more, but would that even be worth it?

What should I do...

I sat there and lamented my situation for who knows how long.

I had no idea how much time had passed but Ethan's panicked voice behind me snapped me out of my daze.

I turned my head towards the school to find a panicked Ethan looking around.

This brought little relief to my heart seeing him back on his feet.

He seemed to have noticed me just as fast as well and quickly came to my side.

"Thank goodness you're alright Master Mikay!" he exclaimed.

"I... Um"...

"I didn't expect that another tribe would even consider raiding us, and in the middle of an exam no less. Thank goodness that you were here!"

"Wha..."

Before I finished I remembered that everyone's memories were altered.

"O-Oh right. Ah ha, no problem. Just... um... doing my job..."

"No really! It's all thanks to you. There were 3 Protégé level attackers among the bandits! We would have suffered much more casualties if it wasn't for you!"

"No no, It's not that big of a deal..." I pleaded

"Modest as always I see! Take some credit Master Mikay! You are invaluable to our village!" Ethan laughed.

But I didn't feel the way he did.

After all, I had just lost someone incredibly important to me.

"Do you think you can handle the rest of this from here Ethan?" I asked.

Ethan didn't answer immediately but instead looked at me with concern.

"A-Are you ok Master Mikay?"

"I... I don't know... I'd like to go home and rest"

I knew the truth.

There wasn't a fight at all, I was completely uninjured.

But I was exhausted, emotionally and mentally.

I didn't want to deal with any of this anymore.

I just wanted to go home and rest.

I'm sure I'll eventually find my resolve to try yet another summoning but right now, I didn't want to do anything.

"I... I understand Master Mikay... I'll take care of things from here. Please get some rest and take care of yourself." Ethan answered.

"Thanks, Ethan" I murmured in response as I turned around and left the school grounds.

The following days after the exam didn't go by easy.

I tried my best to find Phanna but, as I expected, they were nowhere to be found.

There's a pretty high chance that Phanna has already left the Mountainpass area.

But judging from how Phanna moved around the school campus on the exam day, Phanna being able to evade my detection is also a possibility.

The only thing I have left of Phanna's is the strange clothing that they were wearing.

This was the only thing I have left of my second failed summoning.

Yet another portion of my influence is now gone,

And all I have left now is this strange clothing that Phanna was wearing.

I wasn't exactly sure what to do with them but they were the only thing I have of Phanna now.

I didn't know what to do now.

Do I perform another summoning?

 But that would mean I have to permanently give up yet another portion of my Influence.

Yet, continuing to summon champions feels like the most likely path to success.

But is it really though?

There's also the chance that I could become stronger and maybe one day, I could face Hickory myself.

Yet there's no telling if that's possible or how long it would take either.

I didn't know what the right choice was and I definitely didn't want to make the wrong one.

I have made too many wrong decisions already and there's no longer any room for more mistakes.

...

Should I maybe just accept this fate that has befallen my family?

Is this karma giving me punishment for the mistakes I have made in my past?

I didn't know. I wanted to know. Even though I know that this isn't something that I could ever know.

The most logical decision is to just perform one last summon. If that fails then I should probably conserve my Influence and attempt to get stronger to face Hickory one day...

But will I even have the energy or motivation to keep going with that plan after a third failure?

What Phanna said to me in our first conversation echoed in my mind: "What's your plan?"

I didn't know the answer to that question.

Thinking back, Phanna was probably correct.

Without a plan, it makes sense that I can't hope for too much...

Maybe I should summon someone who can help me with planning out the next steps?

But that thought made me feel even more uneasy about my chances of success.

The more I thought about it, the more it felt like the right choice is just to accept the fate that has befallen my family.

What have I always done when these hard decisions came up in the past?

I tried to think.

Yet nothing came to me.

I combed through my memories and still nothing.

The only thing I could remember was the night I lost everything.

But looking back, the right choice was obvious. I should have fled.

But I didn't.

I gave up on that night.

That was my choice, a wrong choice.

Yet, I'm still here today.

Why was I spared?

I didn't know.

Does that mean fate itself wants me to fight against what's yet to happen?

Would that mean the right decision is to make the most logical decision?

What if I fail again?

These thoughts flowed in and out of my mind.

I was frozen by the decisions ahead.

Yet somewhere in the back of my mind, I knew that my time was finite and I couldn't afford to be indecisive.

I was still unsure of what to do.

But this voice urged me on calling me to act while I still cam.

Eventually, I gave in.

I knew my time is limited, I have to act soon, every day that goes by is a day closer to Hickory's potential confrontation against the Mastery League.

And then...

I didn't want to think about that.

I have to hurry.

I collected myself and made my way over to Pillow's aquarium.

Pillow was swimming obliviously inside the aquarium as usual but I'd have to fish it out and drain it again.

I felt sorry to have to do this to Pillow once more but at this point, it was all I could do.

Should I call Ethan over first?

But there's no telling how long the ritual will be and he's probably busy with cleaning up the mess at the school right now.

I felt bad but I didn't want to take up his time like that and especially not now.

After placing Pillow into the mini aquarium in Hickory's room. emptied the large aquarium.

I looked inside it and recalled the first time I saw Phanna sleeping inside and how it filled me with hope and unease.

I didn't know what lies ahead but this was what I must do now.

I took a deep breath to calm myself the best I can and began the ritual process.

Using Forgemaster, I created a sharp stick out of rock and stabbed my arm with it,

A sharp pain erupted from where the object stabbed but this wasn't my first time but I do hope it will be my last.

No.

I know it will be my last.

There are no more additional chances after this.

I focused on moving my influence into the blood that now flowed from my arm and I began activating various abilities and inscribing the aquarium walls with my blood.

I felt a numbing sensation in my fingers as the process continued but I pushed on.

Not the first time. I thought to myself.

Once it was all over. I took a step back and covered my bleeding arm with some cloth.

I've seen other clerics do this to treat these kinds of injuries so I knew it was at least somewhat effective.

I looked towards the aquarium again and wondered what kind of champion would come next.

Hopefully not someone who has a strong accent that I could hardly understand.

That was my final thought as I passed out on the bed inside the room.

## <center>...</center>

Another 2 weeks passed since I started the summoning.

I had been sleeping in what used to be Phanna's room entirely but nothing happened.

Thinking back, it took 4 or 5 weeks after I finished the initial prep to finally summon Phanna.

However, I still can't shake the feeling of unease.

After all, this would be my last summoning.

I didn't have any other chances.

Not only that, I don't even know if getting stronger myself is even possible.

I'm way past my prime now.

Not only that, Getting strong enough to face my daughter is just wishful thinking for most people, even those who are in their prime.

Feelings like these filled each passing day with anxiety.

Today was no exception.

But there was something else that increased my unease today.

Since I wanted to watch over the aquarium as often as possible, I've been reducing how often I went outside to forage or hunt and only in the area near my home.

I also had to store supplies at home and ate whatever I had on hand.

But today, I noticed that my supplies are running low which meant that I have no choice but to go out and gather resources today.

Today, I would need to build up my food supply at home so I can avoid leaving the aquarium alone for the next few days.

After finishing breakfast, I started packing equipment for hunting and foraging.

There wasn't truly a need for me to carry things like a foraging bag or such since I can craft them with Forgemaster once I get to the foraging location.

However, looking like I'm going on a foraging trip has its various advantages.

This is why I am carrying Foraging bags and hunting tools with me. 

After collecting all my hunting tools and foraging bag, I went back to the aquarium room to check if the summoning has progressed much before leaving.

Of course, nothing changed.

Feeling a bit disappointed, I turned around to leave.

But just as I was about to...

CRASH

What?!

I quickly turned around ready for battle with Strengthen and Quicken activated.

I was able to catch sight of the invader crashing through the roof of the room.

I barely had time to get myself into a fighting stance as my attacker landed on the floor under the newly created hole in the roof.

"I BELIEVED YOU!!! I THOUGHT YOU WERE INNOCENT! AND WHAT DO I FIND? EVIDENCE OF QUANTUM COMMUNICATION RIGHT HERE IN YOUR ROOM! AND RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU TOO! WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO SAY FOR YOURSELF MIKAY?!"

The voice was unmistakable.

Even though dust and falling debris obscured the speaker, The speaker's identity was obvious.

"P-Phanna?" I stuttered.

"WHO ELSE WOULD I BE? NOW ANSWER ME! WHAT HAVE YOU DONE? AND WHY?"

I was scared, speechless, confused, anxious...

What did I do to deserve this?

Why me?

What is Phanna talking about?

Is the aquarium ok?

Why now?

All I had were questions, and none of them were answers. 

What do I say?

What do I do?.

I'm pretty sure I can win a fight if it came down to that but I didn't want to damage the aquarium. 

"I... I'm sorry..."

That was the only thing I could say.

As the dust and debris continued to settle, I could start to see Phanna's figure and the reflections of the glass aquarium behind them.

it made me feel a bit better knowing that the aquarium was probably safe.

"I... I am unable to answer your questions." I said knowing full well that that sounded like an invitation for Phanna to attack.

But I have to protect the Aquarium and I was confident in my chances of winning a fight against Phanna. 

But, for some reason, Phanna didn't attack.

Phanna didn't even move towards me.

Instead, Phanna pulled away from me. 

And then... I realized...

Phanna was heading towards the aquarium.

"NO!!" I shouted as I sprinted towards Phanna and the aquarium.

I didn't know what Phanna was going to do. 

I didn't know what is going to happen.

But the only thing I had on my mind now, was the aquarium.
