# Entrance

"Phanna, wake up..." I groaned.

Phanna is laying in bed. 

"5 more minutes..." Phanna groaned back.

"You've been saying that for an hour now..."

"Ugghhhhhhh nooooo......"

"It's almost 10 when do you plan on waking up?"

"When I'm awake..."

Phanna is really not a morning person.

I had suspected that over the past weeks when Phanna was sick.

Fortunately, the illness is in the past now thanks to Ethan's hard work.

Ethan, on the other hand, was rather disappointed when Phanna fully recovered and he no longer had a reason to stay here every day. 

As for me, I felt a huge sense of relief when Phanna overcame the illness without much trouble.

Not only because Phanna was safe now but also because Ethan would no longer be staying with me every day.

Ethan no longer staying with me was strangely freeing and his return to his usual school duties was also a relief for me.

That said, right now, I really wish Ethan was here just to witness Phanna's current state. 

Left with no other options, I walked over to Pillow's Aquarium and lifted pillow out of the water.

Normally, this would be a rather easy task but because of Phanna's constant kidnappings, fishing Pillow out of the aquarium has gotten a bit more difficult. 

After a while trying to get Pillow to swim over, I finally managed to get Pillow out of the aquarium and into my arms.

I walked over to Phanna who was still snoozing comfortably with Pillow in my arms.

Phanna didn't seem to notice this. 

In fact, Phanna didn't seem to bother Pillow all that much while they're sleeping. 

Unbeknownst to Pillow or to Phanna, I cooled Pillow down a bit using my Cooling ability.

Like a cruel prank, I slid the cold Pillow into Phanna's blanket.

Almost immediately, Phanna jumped out of the bed and so did Pillow. 

"Phanna, you NEED to get out of bed right now. we're already late for the entrance exams" I said as I lifted Pillow off the ground and placed it back into its aquarium.

Phanna groaned in response but they did end up getting out of bed. 

I looked over at Phanna sitting there in bed not really doing much and asked.

"What's wrong?"

"What am I supposed to do to 'get ready'?"

Thinking about it, Phanna doesn't really have any clothing other than the stuff that came along with them during the summoning. 

"Oh right, you need to change out of those clothing. You also need to wash yourself. I'll prepare some 
clothing for you so you go and wash yourself."

"Um ok..." Phanna responded clumsily and walked out of the room.

Judging by Phanna's figure, Aurora's old clothing would probably fit just fine.

There was a closet under the bed for storing Aurora's belongings. 

I started looking through some of it and found a set that I remember looked rather good on Aurora back in the day. 

I took it with me and went to the washroom. 

As I entered the washroom. I saw Phanna standing there looking rather confused.

"Phanna what's wrong this time?"

"How am I supposed to wash myself? Nothing looks like a shower here..."

I wasn't sure what a shower is and I honestly wasn't in the mood to find out so I ignored it.

But, to be fair, I had no idea what Phanna's cleaning tools or habits are like

It's only natural for things here to be mysterious to Phanna.

I pointed to the large barrel on the corner of the room and explained.

"You fill that up with water. You can heat the water up with a fire if you want. You can see the space at the bottom of the barrel is for putting firewood in. How hot do you want the water, I can heat it up for you today with my Ability."

"Oh... That sounds needlessly complicated..,"

"Says the person who's name is a number."

"Hey, I'll have you know that my Universal Identification Code is much easier to use than  your name system."

"Right right, anyways. I'll fill this up for you this time."

I attached a tube from the well pump and placed it into the barrel and started pumping groundwater into the barrel.

After the barrel is about 70% full. I stopped pumping and started heating up the water inside with my Heat ability.

"Oh right. How warm do you want the water?" I asked.

"Anything that's comfortable I guess," replied Phanna.

I didn't really know what that meant but if Phanna's normal temperature is 38Â° C then I should probably make the water around that too. 

Not too long after, the water was at that temperature and letting off a bit of steam. 

"Alright Phanna, get yourself washed and changed," I said.

But before I could finish, Phanna climbed into the barrel already and was sitting in it with everything they were originally wearing still on. 

"What are you doing?!" I exclaimed.

"Washing myself?"

"Do you not take your clothes off when you wash yourself?"

"Why would I need to?"

"Your clothes are dirty. That's the point of washing your self."

"Dirty? with what?"

"You know, like dirt and stuff."

"Nah, that stuff doesn't really stick to my clothing. Where I'm from, washing is seen as something therapeutic."

"Um... What?"

Phanna didn't respond. 

I think at this point Phanna knows that I don't really want to listen to Phanna's strange claims.

"Anyways, just wash yourself in there, don't take too long and once you're done, change into these cloaths. I don't want to see you wearing those things after, alright?"

"Why do I have to change..." Phanna moaned in response.

"You've been wearing your old stuff for more than 2 weeks now. It's got to be extremely dirty now."

"Uggh... Fine..." Phanna commented while rolling their eyes.

I left the washroom after getting the reluctant acknowledgement from Phanna and made my way to the front door.

The next issue to tackle is footwear. 

I have combat shoes that I use daily and keep in relatively good condition but extras were not something I had on hand.

My previous summon came with a full set of equipment including boots and armour but Phanna was summoned with just a shirt, shorts and that's it. 

I wasn't sure what to do.

The safest thing to do is to make sandals but Phanna isn't going out for a walk, it's the School of Mastery entrance exams. 

Sandles are definitely not fit for such an occasion. 

I gathered some leather and got a pair of shoes that once belonged to Aurora.

I can probably reassemble it using Forgemaster to fit Phanna's feet. 

At least that was the plan. 

When Phanna came out of the washroom, they were wearing Aurora's old clothing.

The clothing fits just fine as expected but when I looked down at Phanna's feet, I noticed they look nothing like normal feet.

Each foot looked like a big arch with the front of the arch resembling a normal foot except with 3 large and long toes instead, while the backside resembling a large nub.

It wouldn't be too wrong to compare Phanna's Feet to a bird's feet except with a much larger arch and a less pronounced heel-toe.

Although Phanna's feet look like they're covered in normal feet skin and mostly look like feet, a closer inspection makes it abundantly clear these are definitely not normal feet found on normal humanoids.

I didn't know how I could have missed it when I inspected Phanna in the beginning.

"W-What's wrong with your Feet?"

"My feet? Nothing. everything's normal."

"Normal??... know what nevermind." I groaned.

I honestly am lost for words.

Stunned I guess.

I wonder if Ethan noticed it earlier during the various inspections. 

"What do we do about your shoes?" I asked unsure of what to do.

"I can probably just wear those." Phanna said pointing to a pair of sandals near my shoes before continuing, "Some modifications are needed for long term use, however."

"You want to wear slippers to the entrance exams? I thought I explained to you what the exam is already? You can't be serious right?"

"Well if you want to make the modifications now, we can do that here too," Phanna said in an uncaring tone.

"What modifications do you need?" I asked begrudgingly.

"First, it should. fit the curve of my feet. Second, it needs to be flexible both in terms of being able to bend along the main arch as well as allowing my toes to spread out. Lastly, it should be able to wrap around my feet so it doesn't slip off." Phanna answered as if taunting me.

"You basically want a glove for your feet?"

"Well isn't all shoes just gloves for the foot?"

"Whatever, just wear both slippers and standstill."

Phanna did as I said and I took the leather I had and started forming it to Phanna's feet with various abilities. 

I didn't know how to deal with Phanna's toes on the sides that can move out sideways. That's why I just made the base of the shoe wider and left the side toes exposed. 

The rest of the shoes were rather easy to form out of the leather and shortly, both shoes were made.

Phanna stood there as instructed but I could see their face was full of amazement as they watched me perform the whole thing.

However, Phanna didn't utter a single word throughout this whole process. 

Once the whole process was done, all I said was "Alright, let's go. We don't have much time left."

"Oh, uh, right," Phanna responded a little stunned still.

We left my house shortly after and arrived at Ethan's school.

Ethan was giving his speech already as we arrived.

If it wasn't for Phanna's shoe situation, we would have made it on time but unfortunately, we are just a tiny bit late.

This time, we arrived via the main entrance path that leads up to the gravel field which is connected to the school building.

Since I was expected to be part of the judging committee, I already had the abilities Observation and Investigation active before we got anywhere near the school grounds.

By the time the school grounds were fully within my Sphere of Influence, I had noticed a couple instances of observation type abilities that were already active on the campus grounds. 

The source of these abilities was, unmistakeably, the faculty members of the school. 

Ethan was already giving his speech in the middle of the field when Phanna and I got close to the school ground.

I didn't want to draw attention to us so I activated Camouflage to hide Phanna and me as we made our approach. 

I did that partly as a disguise to the students who are seated at the benches near the school building but also partly as an announcement to the staff on-site that we have arrived. 

As if exactly on cue, one of the faculty members came up to us under Camouflage as well.

I didn't exactly recognize who it was because of the Camouflage but they were quite excited as they quietly caught us up on what's happening. 

"Master Mikay, it's really an honour to have you join us. Principal Ethan is currently just giving the welcoming section of the speech. Please make your way over to the Judging stand."

"Thank you. What should Phanna do?"

"Is Phanna able to make it over to the benches unnoticed?" the faculty member asked.

"Are you able to Phanna?" I asked as I poked Phanna.

"Do I have to?"

"Yes, you do. For the new memories, remember?"

Phanna sighed and murmured something strange.

"user load_experiance assassin's traversal"

After saying that, I felt as if something changed inside Phanna.

Phanna was no longer standing in the usual way.

"Phanna, you ok?" I asked out of concern.

"Yeah, I'm fine," Phanna answered uncaringly.

I guess we really aren't off to the best of starts.

"Get me to any corner of the building there and I'll get myself into those benches," Phanna instructed out of the blue.

"Um... Alright..." I studdered.

We made our way to the closest edge by the building under my Camouflage. 

The faculty who was with me was just as confused as I was but phanna didn't give us an explanation and just told us we can go now.

I wasn't sure what was going on but I would be able to keep an eye on Phanna using Observation and Investigation anyway so I agreed and left Phanna alone and went to the judging area.

As I made my way to the seating area for the judging panel, I noticed through my Observation ability that Phanna was apparently scaling the walls of the school building and then entering through what must have been an open window. 

Phanna then made their way through the building somehow evading notice from the various members of faculty watching the event from within the building. 

Phanna finally made it to the part of the building near where the prospective students are seated.

It wasn't until then I finally caught sight of Phanna with my eyes again near the window on the ground floor.

Phanna hopped out of the window and casually walked to the benches and sat down on the ground behind the perspective student.

Surprisingly, none of the prospective students seemed to have noticed.

I was a bit shocked that Phanna was able to do this.

I had a feeling that Phanna was planning on doing something like sneaking around the building but even I couldn't have foreseen this.

As Phanna's infiltration finished, a member of the judging panel beside me informed me that the judging panel introduction is about to begin. 

Of course, I haven't really been listening to Ethan's speech as I was focused on watching Phanna's movements.

That and I didn't really feel the need to listen to Ethan's speech that closely since I've heard it countless times before when I was once a teacher in this school and sat through the same exact speech time and time again for years. 

Then again, at the time, the person giving the speech was Aurora which made the speeches easier to sit through, at least for me.

After I was done watching Phanna's movements, I shifted my attention to Ethan who was giving the usual speech to the prospective students.

"And now, allow me to introduce the judges for this event," Ethan announced.

I knew I was supposed to be the last one to be introduced since I was technically a special guest so I took the time to observe the area some more.

Being much closer than when I first used Observation and Investigation to scan the area, I noticed that there were a few more active ability sources than I had initially noticed.

First off, there were instances of observation type abilities active all around the school grounds. 

These were other onlookers such as upper-level students or faculty who aren't participating in the judging panel this time around. 

However, what really surprised me was that there were 3 people in the group of prospective students that also had observation type abilities active. 

I couldn't exactly make out who they were but if I had to guess, they're the ones who are most likely to pass the entrance exams. 

"Finally, allow me to introduce you all to the final member of our judging panel, Master Mikay" Ethan called.

This time, not only the prospective students were clapping but also many of the onlookers as well.

I let out a sigh and made my way over to where the rest of the judging panel was now standing in the middle of the field.
