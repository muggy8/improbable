# Entrence

"Phanna, wake up..." I groaned.

Phanna is laying in bed. 

"5 more minutes..." Phanna groaned back.

"You've been saying that for an hour now..."

"Ugghhhhhhh nooooo......"

"It's almost 10 when do you plan on waking up?"

"When I'm awake..."

Phanna is really not a morning person.

I had suspected that over the past weeks when Phanna was sick.

Fortunately, the illness is in the past now thanks to Ethan's hard work.

Ethan, on the other hand, was rather dissapointed when Phanna fully recovered and he no longer had a reason to stay here every day. 

As for me, I felt a huge sense of relief when Phanna overcame the illness without much trouble.

Not only beacuse Phanna was safe now but also because Ethan would no longer be staying with me every day, party because he would no longer be staying with me and partly because he would be tending to the business with the school again.

That said, right now, I really wish Ethan was here just to whitness Phanna's current state. 

Left with no other options, I walked over to Pillow's Aquarium and lifted pillow out of the water.

Normally, this would be a rather easy task but because of Phanna's constant kidnappings, fishing Pillow out of the aquarium has gotten a bit more difficult. 

After a while trying to get Pillow to swim over, I finally managed to get Pillow out of the aquarium and into my arms.

I walked over to Phanna who was still snoozing comfortably with Pillow in arms.

Phanna didn't seem to notice this. 

In fact, Phanna didn't seem to bother Pillow all that much while they're sleeping. 

Unbeknowst to Pillow or to Phanna, I cooled Pillow down a bit using my Cooling ability.

Like a crule prank, I slid the cold Pillow into Phanna's blanket.

Almost immediately, Phanna jumped out of the bed and so did Pillow. 

"Phanna, you NEED to get out of bed right now. we're already late for the entrence exams" I said as i lifted Pillow off the ground and placed it back into it's aquarium.

Phanna groaned in responce but they did end up getting out of bed. 

I looked over at Phanna sitting there in bed not really doing much and asked.

"What's wrong?"

"What am I supposed to do to 'get ready'?"

Thinking about it, Phanna doesn't really have any cloathing other than the stuff that was came along during the summoning. 

"Oh right, you need to change out of those cloathing. You also need to wash yourself. I'll prepair some cloathing for you so you go and wash yourself."

"Um ok..." Phanna responded clumzily and walked out of the room.

Judging by Phanna's figure, Aurora's old cloathing would probably fit just fine.

There was a closit under the bed for storing Aurora's belongs. 

I started looking through some of it and found a set that I remember looked rather good on Aurora back in the day. 

I took it with me and went to the washroom. 

As I entered the washroom. I saw Phanna standing there looking rather confused.

"Phanna what's wrong this time?"

"How am I supposed to wash myself? Nothing looks like a shower here..."

I wasn't sure what a shower is and I honestly wans't in the mood to find out so I ignored it.

But, to be fair, I had no idea what Phanna's cleaning tools or habbits are like

It's only natrual for something here to be mysterious.

I pointed to the large barrel on the corner of the room and explained.

"You fill that up with water. You can heat the water up with fire if you want. You can see the space in the bottom of the barrel is for putting firewood in. How hot do you want the water, I can heat it up for you today with my Ability."

"Oh... That sounds needlessly complicated..,"

"Says the person who's name is a number."

"Hey, I'll have you know that my Universal Identification Code is much easier to use than any name system."

"Right right, anyways. I'll fill this up for you this time."

I attached a tube from the well pump and placed it into the barrel and started pumping ground water into the barrel.

After the barrel is about 70% full. I stopped pumping and started heating up the water inside with Heat ability.

"Oh right. How warm do you want the water?" I asked.

"Anything that's comfortable I guess." replied Phanna.

I didn't really know what that meant but if Phanna's normal tempereture is 38Â° C then I should probably make the water around that too. 

Not too long after, the water was at that temperture and letting off a bit of steam. 

"Alright Phanna, get yourself washed and changed." I said.

But before I could finish, Phanna climed into the barrel alrady and was sitting in it with everything they were originally wearing still on. 

"What are you doing?!" I exclaimed.

"Washing myself?"

"Do you not take your cloths off when you wash yourself?"

"Why would I need to?"

"Your cloathing is dirty. That's the point of washing your self."

"Dirty? with what?"

"You know, like dirt and stuff."

"Nah, that stuff doesn't really stick to my clothings. Where I'm from, washing is seen as something theraputic."

"Um... What?"

Phanna didn't respond. 

I think at this point Phanna knows that I dont really want to listen to Phanna's strange claims.

"Anyways just wash yourself in there, dont take too long and once your done, change into these cloaths. I dont want to see you wearing those things after alright?"

"Why do I have to change..." Phanna moaned in responce.

"You've been wearing your old stuff for more than 2 weeks now. It's got to be extremely dirty now."

"Uggh... Fine..." Phanna commented while rolling their eyes.

I lift the washroom after getting the reluctant ackneledgement from Phanna and made my way to the front door.

Next issue to tackle is foot wear. 

I have combat shoes that I use daily and keep in relatlvely good condition but extras were not something I had on hand.

My previous summon came with a full set of equipment including boots and armor but Phanna was summoned with just a shirt, shorts and that's it. 

I wasn't sure what to do.

The safest thing to do is to make sandles but Phanna isn't going out for a walk, it's the School of Mastery entrence exams. 

Sandles are definately not fit for such an occasion. 

I gathered some leather and got a pair of shoes that once belonged to Aurora.

I can probably reassemble it using Forgemaster to fit Phanna's feet. 

At least that was the plan. 

When Phanna came out of the washroom, they were wearing Aurora's old clothing.

The clothing fits just fine as expected but when I looked down at Phanna's feet, I noticed they look nothing like normal feet.

Each foot looked like a big arch with the front of the arch resembling a normal foot except with 3 large and long toes instead, while the back side resembling a large nub.

It wouldn't be too wrong to compair Phanna's Feet to a bird feet except with a much larger arch and a less pronounced heel toe.

Although Phanna's feet looks like they're covered in normal feet skin and mostly look like feet, closer inspection makes it abundantly clear these are definitely not normal feet found on normal humanoids.

I didn't know how I could have missed it when I saw Phanna the first time.n

"W-What's wrong with your Feet?"

"My feet? Nothing. everything's normal."

"Normal??... know what nevermind." I groaned.

I honestly am lost for words.

Stuned I guess.

I wonder if Ethan noticed it earlier during the vasious inspections. 

"What do we do about your shoes?" I asked unsure of what to do.

"I can probably just wear those." Phanna said pointing to a pair of sandles near my shoes before continueing, "Some modifications are needed for long term use however."

"You want to wear slippers to the entrence exams? I thought I expained what the exam to you is alrengy? You can't be serious right?"

"Well if you want to make the modifications now, we can do that here too." Phanna said in an uncaring tone.

"What modifications do you need?" I asked begrudgingly.

"First, it shoud. fit the curve of my feet. Second, it needs to be flexiable both in terms of being able to bend along the main arch as well as allowing my toes to spread out. Lastly, it should be able to wrap around my feet so it doesn't slip off." Phanna answered as if taunting me.

"You basically want a glove for your feet?"

"Well isn't all shoes just gloves for the foot?"

"Whatever, just wear both slippers and stand still."

Phanna did as I said and I took the leather I had and started forming it to Phanna's feet with various abilities. 

I didn't know how to deal with Phanna's side toes on the front that can move out side ways so it just made the base of the shoe wider and left the side toes exposed. 

The rest of the shoes were rather easy to form out of the leather and shortly, both shoes were made.

Phanna stood there as instructed but I could see their face was full of amazement as they watched me perfom the whole thing.

However, Phanna didn't utter a single word throughout this whole precess.
