# What's done is done

Melody, the meek elf girl who Phanna killed during the Ethan's school's entrance exam, was looking at us with confusion and terror from within the aquarium.

What was Melody doing in here? The only reasonable way for anything to get into the aquarium is through summoning at this point but then why is Melody here?

Don't tell me...

"Mikay! Explain this!" Phanna commanded interrupting my thought and startling the Melody that was in the Aquarium.

"This... I'm still trying to get my head wrapped around this whole situation as well but... it seemed that my Summoning Ritual has summoned Melody..."

"Summoning? I'm sick and tired of your lies. Tell me what's happening!"

"I'm not lying!"

"How do you expect me to believe that? First I find you performing Quantum Communication and now I see you reviving the dead! How can you be so unethical?!" Phanna yelled.

"Unethical? Me? Do you even know what you're talking about?"

"Yes I do! Those who are dead should be respected, honored and remember, not reanimated on some random whim like you are." Phanna said, practically yelling, while glaring at me.

"Reanimating the dead? If I had that kind of power, I wouldn't be here risking everything trying to summon a champion for assistance! If I had that kind of power, why would I have even bothered to ask you for assistance?!"

"Then how do you explain that!" Phanna shouted pointed at Melody.

The frightened Melody curled up inside the glass box further as Phanna pointed to wards her.

"I don't know! Summoning Rituals summon someone who's willing. What if she isn't even Melody!" I plead.

At my reply, Phanna gave me a look of distrust as they turned towards the frightened Melody.

"I'm sorry you had to see that." Phanna said to the frightened Melody before continuing, "I am User A244X0Z4305PHAN4. This person I was arguing with claims to be Mikay. Would be able to introduce us to yourself?"

Phanna was somehow about to change their tone completely as if it was almost completely natural as they spoke to the Melody lookalike.

"I... My... My name is.... M... Melody..." she said in a frightened tone.

"P... Please don't hurt me too much... I... I'm sorry I tried to kill you Mr. Phanna. If... If you want to, you can have my life..."

Phanna glared at me in disgust as Melody spoke her words.

Although I hadn't done anything that I felt was so horribly wrong, Phanna, was of a different onion.

In fact, I wasn't even sure how Melody got here in the firs place.

"Um, Melody, can I ask you what was the last thing you remembered before you found yourself in this glass box?" I asked trying to figure out what exactly happened.

"Uh... Ummm... I was... Um... Having a chat with you two, Master Ethan and I think Amanda was there too."

Something sounded strange about Melody's comment.

I didn't recall happening at all. In fact, I couldn't remember a time where all the people Melody named were together and having a chat.

Phanna seemed to have noticed it too as their face twisted.

"Do you remembered what you all were talking about?" I asked.

"We... Mr. Phanna was... Telling me about the fact that... that... he had nothing to live for... and how to kill him..."

"Do you remember about how I said to go about killing me?" Phanna asked.

"Y... You said that... You would get stronger over 3 seconds if attacked and... and that we had to vaporize your... spine..."

Phanna's face twisted with discomfort at Melody's answer and I, too, can feel my own face twist in confusion.

Melody quivered in fear at the sight of our expressions but she couldn't pull herself any further away from us in the aquarium.

"I'm sorry..." Phanna finally spoke before slowly walking to the bed and sitting down.

The dust and debris from Phanna's entrance has largely settled by now but the bed that Phanna was sitting on now has turned into a complete mess.

"I... I'm sorry too. The two of us has been through alot. Don't worry we wont hurt you" I said turning back to face Melody.
