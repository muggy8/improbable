# Another Way Forward

Melody, the meek elf girl who Phanna killed during the Ethan's school's entrance exam, was looking at us with confusion and terror from within the aquarium.

What was Melody doing in here? The only reasonable way for anything to get into the aquarium is through summoning at this point but then why is Melody here?

Don't tell me...

"Mikay! Explain this!" Phanna commanded interrupting my thought and startling the Melody that was in the Aquarium.

"This... I'm still trying to get my head wrapped around this whole situation as well but... it seemed that my Summoning Ritual has summoned Melody..."

"Summoning? I'm sick and tired of your lies. Tell me what's happening!"

"I'm not lying!"

"How do you expect me to believe that? First I find you performing Quantum Communication and now I see you reanimating the dead! How can you be so unethical?!" Phanna yelled.

"Unethical? Me? Do you even know what you're talking about?"

"Yes I do! Those who are dead should be respected, honored and remember, not reanimated on some random whim like you are." Phanna said, practically yelling, while glaring at me.

"Reanimating the dead? If I had that kind of power, I wouldn't be here risking everything trying to summon a champion for assistance! If I had that kind of power, why would I have even bothered to ask you for assistance?!"

"Then how do you explain that!" Phanna shouted pointed at Melody.

The frightened Melody curled up inside the glass box further as Phanna pointed to wards her.

"I don't know! Summoning Rituals summon someone who's willing. What if she isn't even Melody!" I plead.

At my reply, Phanna gave me a look of distrust as they turned towards the frightened Melody.

"I'm sorry you had to see that." Phanna said to the frightened Melody before continuing, "I am User A244X0Z4305PHAN4. This person I was arguing with claims to be Mikay. Would be able to introduce us to yourself?"

Phanna was somehow about to change their tone completely as if it was almost completely natural as they spoke to the Melody lookalike.

"I... My... My name is.... M... Melody..." she said in a frightened tone.

"P... Please don't hurt me too much... I... I'm sorry I tried to kill you Mr. Phanna. If... If you want to, you can have my life..."

Phanna glared at me in disgust as Melody spoke her words.

Although I hadn't done anything that I felt was so horribly wrong, Phanna, was of a different onion.

In fact, I wasn't even sure how Melody got here in the firs place.

"Um, Melody, can I ask you what was the last thing you remembered before you found yourself in this glass box?" I asked trying to figure out what exactly happened.

"Uh... Ummm... I was... Um... Having a chat with you two, Master Ethan and I think Amanda was there too."

Something sounded strange about Melody's comment.

I didn't recall happening at all. In fact, I couldn't remember a time where all the people Melody named were together and having a chat.

Phanna seemed to have noticed it too as their face twisted.

"Do you remembered what you all were talking about?" I asked.

"We... Mr. Phanna was... Telling me about the fact that... that... he had nothing to live for... and how to kill him..."

"Do you remember about how I said to go about killing me?" Phanna asked.

"Y... You said that... You would get stronger over 3 seconds if attacked and... and that we had to vaporize your... spine..."

Phanna's face twisted with discomfort at Melody's answer and I, too, can feel my own face twist in confusion.

Melody quivered in fear at the sight of our expressions but she couldn't pull herself any further away from us in the aquarium.

"I'm sorry..." Phanna finally spoke before slowly walking to the bed and sitting down.

Phanna must have realized that the stuff that Melody just spoke was something that never happened, at least in front of us the way that Melody had described.

I wasn't too surprised by this but Phanna seemed to find this situation extremely uncomfortable.

"I'm sorry Melody. The two of us has been through alot. Don't worry we wont hurt you" I said turning back to face Melody.

Melody gave me a meek nod and but she didn't seem to relax at all.

Wanting to show the sincerity behind my statement I turned around and made my way to the desk opposite to the bed Phanna was sitting on now, took the chair out and seated myself on the chair.

The falling debris and dust has mostly cleared by now allowing us to see each other better.

Seeing this, Melody relaxed a little.

"Melody, can I ask you a few questions?" I asked.

Melody gave me yet another meek nod.

Seeing this, I continued.

I wanted to ask her if she'd be willing to help me with rescuing my daughter Hickory but I knew that in her current state she'd agree to anything.

However, more importantly, if this Melody was anything like the Melody that Phanna killed, then there's little to no chance of her being able to help in any way.

Knowing this, I was feeling a bit uncomfortable about my current summoning already.

But that aside, I needed to confirm anyways.

"Melody, you said you were sorry for trying to kill Phanna." I spoke gesturing to Phanna sitting on the bed before continuing. "Can you tell me what happened after and why?"

"I... I... The reason I wanted to kill Mr. Phanna is... b... Because I... I wanted to die... My... My plan was to die to karma... But I almost died to Mr. Phanna instead... I heard from Master Ethan that... that... you... you were the one who saved me... As for what happened after my... my attempt on Mr. Phanna's life... I... I don't know... I woke up in a room... with you, Mr, Phanna, my sister Amanda and Master Ethan together..."

Melody's words were shaky and uneven.

But I could hardly blame her since I can still see the fear in her eyes.

Not wanting to scare melody any further, I looked away towards Phanna sitting on the bed seemingly lost in thought.

One thing was now clear to me.

I now have another failed summoning.

Melody is more or less the same Melody that Phanna killed except that, somehow, she had survived Phanna's counter attack.

But I know Melody's strengths and weaknesses pretty well after seeing her in action during the exam and more so considering I was her pre-exam inspector.

What do I do?

I had expected that I would need to teach the champions I've summoned but Melody is definitely not a fighter and Phanna... is a lost cause...

It was at this time, that Phanna spoke up and broke me out of my thought spiral, this time, before I could even start spiraling.

How very Phanna like, I thought to myself as I found comfort in something I used to find annoying.

"Mikay, it seems like Faster than Light travel is the only possibility left to explain what is happening here. Tell me, how exactly did you manage it?"

Of course, the things that Phanna said doesn't make a lick of sense but somehow, I still found comfort hearing these nonsensical things from Phanna for some reason.

"I'm not sure what you're saying Phanna but I'm guessing you mean with Melody right?"

Phanna gave me a condescending look but nodded to my question anyways.

"It's the same thing that happened to you. I performed a summoning ritual and she answered my call just like you did."

"I guess even you have no idea what you've done." Phanna sighed before continuing.

"It's hard to believe but the only explanation for what is happening to me and Melody over there is faster than light travel which should be all but impossible except under very specific circumstances."

My gut instinct is telling me to just ignore Phanna but for some reason, even this feeling still somehow brought me some relief.

"I'm sorry, I have absolutely no idea what you're talking about" I said back to Phanna

"I see. You clearly have no idea the significance of what you've done I take it?"

"It's just a normal summoning ritual. That's all, you accepted my call and this Melody here did too." I rebutted.

"This 'Summoning' ritual that you've done, teach it to me." Phanna demanded.

"what?" I blurted out in surprise.

"This isn't something I can just teach you like nothing. It takes years for most people to learn how to use Influence comfortably and summoning rituals are some of the most advanced ways of using Influence. Teaching someone like you how to perform Summoning Rituals would take years maybe even decades."

I found myself trying my best to turn down Phanna's request but Phanna didn't give me much care to my statements and just frowned at me a bit.

I was no longer working with Phanna anymore and I'm sure they wouldn't want to work with me anymore either considering what happened during the exam.

But despite this Phanna seemed adamant on learning the summoning ritual.

Not wanting to give into Phanna's demands, I continued listing reasons why I teaching them the summoning rituals.

"And beside, you'd need to be at least level 2 in terms of Sphere of Influence to even begin to perform summoning. Not to mention you don't have a single bit of Influence right now. And to top it off, we don't even know if you can get gain any Influence since it's something that people here are born with."

Yet, event despite everything I've said, Phanna didn't even show the tiniest bit of hesitation but instead instead just looked at me with discontent.

After a while, Phanna finally spoke up after a moment of silence.

"Are you out of excuses now?" Phanna asked.

Without skipping a beat, Phanna started refuting each of my points.

"If you're worried about time, then don't. I have an unlimited lifespan so I could hardly care how long it takes to learn these skills even if I have to learn it manually. And if you're worried that you might wither away then I can grant you an unlimited lifespan too. If this 'influence' thing you speak of is of concern then again don't. I'm sure what you call influence and what I think of as influence are completely different things but even if no one knows what it is. I'm confident that I'll be able to figure out what it is using the scientific method ."

That's right... Phanna did say they had an infinite lifespan or something like that before.

But even then...

"W...Why are you asking me for this? I thought you hated me." I questioned.

"Hate is a strong word." Phanna replied before leaning back into the bed a bit and continuing.

"I don't really hate you. I was very angry. To be honest, I'm still suspicious of you. But that doesn't change the fact that you might have done something that goes even beyond my understanding of the universe..."

And then there was silence.

Melody was still in the corner of the glass aquarium.

I could tell she might have felt a bit better knowing our attention were no longer on her but I still felt a bit bad for pretending she didn't exist.

"Mikay, I dont know if I've told you this before or not but my goal for the past couple hundred years was to discover or create something new, something no one knew about, to experience something unique, something that no one else has experienced. In other words, to be unique, to be more than just a nobody in the endless sea of people."

Phanna then looked up toward the hole in the roof of the room we are now in and into the clear afternoon sky.

"I didn't succeed in that goal and that's what got me here. At first I though this whole world was just a simulation... a dream of sorts. But now, not only did I find out this whole place is real, but I also found potential evidence of the fundamental laws of nature being broken."

Then Phanna looked away from the sky and back at me, this time with much more fire in their eyes.

"This is why I must have you teach me this summoning ritual."

Phanna's words left me speechless.

Refusing this request just felt like the wrong thing to do but for I cant just abandon my own goals.

But then again, how do I proceed further on my own goals anyways?

I felt like I was caught between a rock and a hard place.

That was when Phanna spoke up one more time.

"Hickory"

"Hun?"

"Your daughter Hickory is on your mind." Phanna said.

It was as if Phanna was reading my mind but I didn't say anything and just looked away instead.

Phanna seemed to have understood that as acknowledgment of their question and proceeded to speek.

"I'm sorry. I made light of your goals before." Phanna apologized.

This comment took me off guard.

The normally confrontational and uncooperative Phanna has melted away and before me was a side of Phanna I've never seen before.

"Does this mean..." I said in hesitation slowly turning back towards phanna.

"...Yes, I'm willing to truly put in my effort to help you save your daughter now." Phanna answered with a bit of hesitation as well.

This answer from Phanna made me feel bittersweet.

I was happy to know that Phanna was back on my side now but I felt bitter for the time we spent earlier with Phanna barely caring for my goals.

But judging from Phanna's hesitant expression and actions, I'm sure they knew this as well.

But having Phanna throw me for a loop once, I wasn't as ready to just go along with whatever Phanna wanted this time around.

"Lets... make a compromise." I said hesitantly. "After what happened before, I'm not as willing to just trust you completely just as you are suspicious of me. That said, I can agree to teach you what I can about Influence and in exchange, you help me in whatever way you can in terms of saving my daughter Hickory. If we are able to successful prevent my daughter's fate or if you are able to master the art of manipulating Influence then I shall teach you the Summoning Ritual. Sounds fair right?"

"I guess that's only fair." Phanna said looking a little dissatisfied or maybe disappointing.
