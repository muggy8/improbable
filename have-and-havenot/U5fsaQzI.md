# Another

Melody, the meek elf girl who Phanna killed during the Ethan's school's entrance exam, was looking at us with confusion and terror from within the aquarium.

What was Melody doing in here? The only reasonable way for anything to get into the aquarium is through summoning at this point but then why is Melody here?

Don't tell me...

"Mikay! Explain this!" Phanna commanded interrupting my thought and startling the Melody that was in the Aquarium.

"This... I'm still trying to get my head wrapped around this whole situation as well but... it seemed that my Summoning Ritual has summoned Melody..."

"Summoning? I'm sick and tired of your lies. Tell me what's happening!"

"I'm not lying!"

"How do you expect me to believe that? First I find you performing Quantum Communication and now I see you reanimating the dead! How can you be so unethical?!" Phanna yelled.

"Unethical? Me? Do you even know what you're talking about?"

"Yes I do! Those who are dead should be respected, honored and remember, not reanimated on some random whim like you are." Phanna said, practically yelling, while glaring at me.

"Reanimating the dead? If I had that kind of power, I wouldn't be here risking everything trying to summon a champion for assistance! If I had that kind of power, why would I have even bothered to ask you for assistance?!"

"Then how do you explain that!" Phanna shouted pointed at Melody.

The frightened Melody curled up inside the glass box further as Phanna pointed to wards her.

"I don't know! Summoning Rituals summon someone who's willing. What if she isn't even Melody!" I plead.

At my reply, Phanna gave me a look of distrust as they turned towards the frightened Melody.

"I'm sorry you had to see that." Phanna said to the frightened Melody before continuing, "I am User A244X0Z4305PHAN4. This person I was arguing with claims to be Mikay. Would be able to introduce us to yourself?"

Phanna was somehow about to change their tone completely as if it was almost completely natural as they spoke to the Melody lookalike.

"I... My... My name is.... M... Melody..." she said in a frightened tone.

"P... Please don't hurt me too much... I... I'm sorry I tried to kill you Mr. Phanna. If... If you want to, you can have my life..."

Phanna glared at me in disgust as Melody spoke her words.

Although I hadn't done anything that I felt was so horribly wrong, Phanna, was of a different onion.

In fact, I wasn't even sure how Melody got here in the firs place.

"Um, Melody, can I ask you what was the last thing you remembered before you found yourself in this glass box?" I asked trying to figure out what exactly happened.

"Uh... Ummm... I was... Um... Having a chat with you two, Master Ethan and I think Amanda was there too."

Something sounded strange about Melody's comment.

I didn't recall happening at all. In fact, I couldn't remember a time where all the people Melody named were together and having a chat.

Phanna seemed to have noticed it too as their face twisted.

"Do you remembered what you all were talking about?" I asked.

"We... Mr. Phanna was... Telling me about the fact that... that... he had nothing to live for... and how to kill him..."

"Do you remember about how I said to go about killing me?" Phanna asked.

"Y... You said that... You would get stronger over 3 seconds if attacked and... and that we had to vaporize your... spine..."

Phanna's face twisted with discomfort at Melody's answer and I, too, can feel my own face twist in confusion.

Melody quivered in fear at the sight of our expressions but she couldn't pull herself any further away from us in the aquarium.

"I'm sorry..." Phanna finally spoke before slowly walking to the bed and sitting down.

Phanna must have realized that the stuff that Melody just spoke was something that never happened, at least in front of us the way that Melody had described.

I wasn't too surprised by this but Phanna seemed to find this situation extremely uncomfortable.

"I'm sorry Melody. The two of us has been through alot. Don't worry we wont hurt you" I said turning back to face Melody.

Melody gave me a meek nod and but she didn't seem to relax at all.

Wanting to show the sincerity behind my statement I turned around and made my way to the desk opposite to the bed Phanna was sitting on now, took the chair out and seated myself on the chair.

The falling debris and dust has mostly cleared by now allowing us to see each other better.

Seeing this, Melody relaxed a little.

"Melody, can I ask you a few questions?" I asked.

Melody gave me yet another meek nod.

Seeing this, I continued.

I wanted to ask her if she'd be willing to help me with rescuing my daughter Hickory but I knew that in her current state she'd agree to anything.

However, more importantly, if this Melody was anything like the Melody that Phanna killed, then there's little to no chance of her being able to help in any way.

Knowing this, I was feeling a bit uncomfortable about my current summoning already.

But that aside, I needed to confirm anyways.

"Melody, you said you were sorry for trying to kill Phanna." I spoke gesturing to Phanna sitting on the bed before continuing. "Can you tell me what happened after and why?"

"I... I... The reason I wanted to kill Mr. Phanna is... b... Because I... I wanted to die... My... My plan was to die to karma... But I almost died to Mr. Phanna instead... I heard from Master Ethan that... that... you... you were the one who saved me... As for what happened after my... my attempt on Mr. Phanna's life... I... I don't know... I woke up in a room... with you, Mr, Phanna, my sister Amanda and Master Ethan together..."

Melody's words were shaky and uneven.

But I could hardly blame her since I can still see the fear in her eyes.

Not wanting to scare melody any further, I looked away towards Phanna sitting on the bed seemingly lost in thought.

One thing was now clear to me.

I now have another failed summoning.

Melody is more or less the same Melody that Phanna killed except somehow, she had survived Phanna's counter attack.
