"user load_experiance assassin's traversal" I said quietly.

_Loading assassin experience's traversal experience subset... Complete._

As the experience loaded, I could feel my posture change.

It's been such a long time since I last experienced the oddities of loading in an experience.

The strangest part of loading experiences is that despite gaining a bunch of experience, I had gained absolutely no new memories.

Yet despite gaining no new declarative memories, I felt my awareness increase dramatically. 

Because of my heightened senses, I noticed Mikay looking at me and the strange person who seems semi-transparent standing beside him.

"Are you ok?" Mikay asked.

"Yeah, I'm fine," I replied said trying to brush him off.
 
I continued to look around the area wondering if I would be able to make my way over to the benches undetected.

I honestly didn't really know if Mikay's demand of "sneak into the student seating area undetected" was possible or not but I had a feeling that if it was possible, the assassin experience pack would be the tool that is most likely able to be able to make that happen.

Somehow, with the help of the experience pack, I was able to formulate a plan. 

I could just jump into the building and make my way to the other side stealthily.

Having my thought patterns modified in this way is rather alarming no matter how many times I've experienced it.

Yet despite having some knowledge that this has happened before, I don't have any recollection of any event like this happening in the past.

"... As you all know, learning and mastering the use of Abilities is an extremely difficult process. Many of the great ability users of the past and present have all gone through rigorous training and endured many hardships to earn the strength and wisdom to be able to wield such power. That's why for many of you, your road to obtaining mastery over various Abilities began well before any of you have even set foot on this campus. Do not see this as a burden but as the next challenge to overcome..." Ethan continued to bellow.

Ethan has been speaking since before we arrived but before the experience pack loaded, I didn't feel like Ethan's speech was that loud. 

In fact, I was mostly ignoring him up until this point.

But after the experience pack successfully loaded in, I felt as if his words were deafeningly loud.

I felt like I could probably make use of Ethan's speech as a distraction to cover my approach.

The feeling also told me I can't do anything out here in the open. 

"Get me to any corner of the building there and I'll get myself into those benches," I said in a commanding tone surprising even myself.

"Um... Alright..." Mikay responded in a surprising way and we began moving right away.

Mikay and his friend seem to be rather cooperative and we made our way over to the side of the building. 

I made a point to move in a way where Mikay or his accomplice is always between me and the crowds.

As we moved, Ethan's speech seems to boom louder and louder.

"... The goal of our competition isn't to find the strongest or the most capable amongst you. Instead is to find the most driven individuals with the highest aptitude. That's why our entrance exam is organized as a series of one on one matches where the winning condition is to push your opponent off the platforms. As applicants, you are encouraged to use every tool at your disposal to accomplish this task however, our goal is not to have you all kill each other but rather to demonstrate your drive and aptitude as stated earlier. As such, the use of lethal force is strictly forbidden during this competition..."

I found myself with Mikay and his accomplice by the edge of the building. 

After observing my surroundings again, I felt that I'm ready to perform the infiltration as soon as I'm alone.

"Thanks, you two can go now," I said.

Mikay and his accomplice gave me a confused look but they eventually did end up leaving.

After Mikay and his accomplice left, I didn't act until the two were far enough away.

While waiting, I got a bit curious so I activated the body mod that lets me observe Gravitational Waves.

"user wave_receivers start" I whispered to initiate the Gravitational-Wave Observatory in my ears.

A fuzzy static in the far off, maybe even infinite, distance became noticeable.

Soon enough, things much closer became distinguishable as silhouettes against the blur of the background fuzz. 

I remember being a bit taken aback by how high fidelity this simulation was the first time I did this.

I was surprised that even the gravitational waves were fully simulated.

Then again, I wasn't sure how surprised I should be since it might have been a normal aspect of simulated worlds that no one really cares about since it's not really something worth mentioning.

I was quite impressed by how realistic this simulation but because this is my first time inside one, I'm not exactly sure if this was normal or not.

However, based on the Copernican Principle, logically speaking, I should expect this to be a rather normal simulation.

But none the less, the world in this simulation is rather impressive overall. 

Too bad it runs on karma.

I let out a mental sigh.

My instincts from the experience pack were telling me that everything is ready now so I began making my move.

I engaged the leg tendon tensioning apparatus in my hips and my legs suddenly became kind of like bouncy springs.

I lowered myself to the ground and prepared to jump.

As I did, I felt the tendon that ran all the way down from my hip bone to my foot bone tense up.

I then swung my arms as I released my jump and took off for the 4th-floor window, the highest floor of the building.

As I did, I could feel the silhouettes of the building and all of its inhabitants shift against the fuzzy feeling cosmological background audio as my perspective shifted during my leap.

I grabbed the only window on the 4th floor of this face of the building and peeked in.

The window I was peaking in was the window at the end of the hallway, 

The hallway I was looking at was long and ended with what seemed like a staircase. There seemed to be a row of rooms on one side and windows on the other.

There were a lot of spectators in the hallway watching Ethan on the field through the windows.

The windows were, fortunately, all open.

I definitely didn't notice this earlier but my instincts definitely did it seems.

I don't think this is a good path to approach from but my instincts were a step ahead.

It seems that the other floors are no good as well, according to my instincts anyways.

I took a look around me to take in the view again.

I was hanging on to the window of the 4th floor of this building, the only window the 4th floor has on this wall. 

To one side, an open field with Ethan making his booming speech, to the other, a bunch of bushes and trees.

There were 3 other windows below the one I was hanging on to below me, I could even touch the top of the 3rd-floor window with my feet.

The only thing above the window I was hanging on to was the roof.

It was a slanted roof with rainwater gutters on the side. 

Some of the people standing in the hallway watching the speech looked clearly bored by the speech

"... Of course, we also understand that in the heat of the moment, sometimes lethal force may be used accidentally. This is especially the case for those of you who are from harsher environments. That's why as the overseers of this exam, my team and I will intervene if we judge that an action may result in the loss of life. In the case of such an event, the violator in question will be given a round loss. Remember, this test is a test of drive and aptitude and restraint is a key part of that..." boomed Ethan's voice.

Honestly, I really just want to get this over with. 

The hypersensitivity I got from the experience pack is making this whole process extra painful.

I could probably just drop down, run around the outside of the building

But my instincts told me no.

I was starting to get a good handle on what stuff is my thoughts and what stuff is the experience pack's thoughts by this point.

The plan I thought of before was to just jump into the building and sneaking around to the other side but now, that plan seems like it's out of the question. 

Now that I think about it, did the experience pack actually come up with the plan?

Now that I had a better handle on it, I realized it doesn't invade my conscious mind at all and only takes the form of instincts or feelings. 

Basically subconscious and reflexive mental processes.

Not seeing many other options, I blanked my mind and decided to just trust the experience pack to take it from here. 

All I needed to do was enter a state of flow and things might just work out I guess.

I took a deep breath and began to move.

I shifted myself to the corner of the window.

I then took hold of the corner of the window with one of my foot and moved the rest of my body out of the window's view

The giant arc in my foot allowed my toes to get a decent grip on the window ledge while keeping the heel of my foot firmly pressed against the outside wall for leverage and stability.

Once I got a good grip on the window with my foot, I let go of the window with my hands, straightened my other leg and appeared to be standing sideways on the wall.

Then, I used my free leg to push off against the wall.

With one foot firmly gripping the window and the other foot powering a powerful jump, I found my face approaching the wall but my grip on the window quickly gave way and before I know it, I was flying through the air.

Suddenly, I felt my hand grab something and just like that, I was now hanging off of the rain gutters of the roof.

I had no idea how sturdy these are but I pulled myself up and took a look to see what the top of this roof held.

The roof was unremarkable just a normal slanted roof made of stone.

There was a bell tower on the other end of the roof and connects to another wing of the building. 

Some people were standing on it looking at Ethan.

After confirming this, I hung on the rain gutter with my hands and made my way to the last room of this wing of the building.

The room was empty, so I let myself into it from the window.

From here on out, it'll all be acting.

Good thing I mostly look like a commoner now.

I guess putting on Mikay's old cloaths was a good idea after all. 

I casually walked out the door trying to match my footsteps to Ethan's speech.

"... Now that you all are aware of the rules of the exam and what we are looking for, allow me to introduce our panel of judges." Ethan boomed.

Clap, Clap, Clap, Clap, Clap, Clap, Clap...

Step, Step, Step, Step, Step, Step, Step...

Using Ethan's speech and the applause as distraction, I quietly made my way to the ground floor and then to the window in the hallway just behind where the other students are.

For some reason, there weren't many people here. 

In fact, the entire wing of the building was almost empty.

I hopped out of the window, walked towards the seating area and sat down on the floor behind the last row. 

"user unload_experience assassin's traversal" I whispered under my breath wile congratulating myself on a job well done.

My whisper was completely drowned out by the sound of Ethan's voice but that was all part of the plan. 

As the experience unloaded, I felt my posture change back to how I normally am and away went my hypersensitivity as well.

And with my hypersensitivity gone, so too was Ethan's hold on my attention

I turned to look for where Mikay ended up and I noticed he was standing by the other wing of the building.

There was also quite a group of people gathered in every window of the building behind him.

I guess my handler for this simulation turned out to be quite the celebrity.

I could feel my face twitching unsure of how to react.

He was looking at me too.

Then, somebody patted him on the shoulder and got him to look away. 

I looked down at my shoes once Mikay stopped looking at me.

I really didn't expect Mikay to be able to cook up something like this so fast.

I don't really know if I should be happy or sad that my simulation ended like this.

Suddenly a boom of applause erupted again as I looked up from my seat.

Mikay was standing in the middle of the field next to a bunch of other people I don't know. 

Ethan was there too.

"Master Mikay, if you may," Ethan said.

I was able to hear him, but he was nowhere near as loud as he was when I had the assassin's traversal experience pack loaded. 

Mikay gave Ethan a nod and did some hand gestures at the ground and suddenly, 4 square platforms rose out of the ground. 

They rose to about half a meter up off of the ground and stopped.

The top of the platforms was perfectly flat.

Many of the other prospective students seem to be watching in awe as this happened. 

Though what surprisedme the most was that this event was observable using Gravitational Waves as well.

Not only was this ground movement interesting to see, but the Gravitational Wave signature of this movement was also fully simulated. 

Since Gravitational Waves are produced by accelerating mass and passes through everything, I was able to "see" what happened under those rising platforms as well.

From what I can see, the ground below is "flowing" into those 4 platforms that are being extruded out of the ground. 

It's almost as if the stones were liquid.

But judging from their mass, they definitely are stone.

I guess Physics in this world doesn't really make sense.

Not that I should expect otherwise allowing random chance to generate my simulated world and all.

After the stone platforms were raised out of the ground, Mikay and the other people he was with walked away to stand by the edge of the building where they were originally standing earlier.

Then, Ethan began to speak again. 

I completely zoned him out and started looking around. 

I started observing the other people that are sitting around the benches hoping to find a slime person that I could sneak up to and befriend. 

If a slime could exist as a pet in this world then there's no reason why there wouldn't be people made of slime in this world too. 

Or at least that's how my thought process went. 

Unfortunately, there were no slime people here.

All the other prospective students seem to be bipedal fleshy humans. nothing too crazy. 

They all seem to have relatively similar external appearances as well which was peculiar considering that randomness generated this world. 

Should I have been surprised, been disappointed or expected it?

I wasn't too sure what the answer to that is.

As I was observing the group of students, they started to stand.

I followed after them and stood up too. 

No one seems to have noticed that I was late or the fact that I sat somewhere slightly different. 

The crowd of students slowly made their way to Ethan and started to form a line. 

I purposely positioned myself at the end of the line.

I didn't know what the line was for since I've been zoning Ethan out since I sat down.

That's why I instinctively gravitated to the back of the line to not make a fool of myself if I ended up needing a few tries to do whatever it is that we're all lining up here for. 

Pretty soon, I was standing before Ethan.

"Glad to see you here, Phanna"

"Honestly, I'd rather not be."

"Don't be like that, I'm sure you'll get something out of this experience."

"Mikay said the same thing."

"See, I'm sure you'll find this event worthwhile. Here's your card." Ethan said handing me a card with a green circle on it. 

"What's this for?"

"it's your turn order."

I wanted to ask 'How does this work?' but I decided not to just as I was about to speak since doing so would be the same as admitting I wasn't listening to his grand speech earlier. 

"Oh, thanks." was my reply instead.

"So anything else I should do right now?" I asked after I took the card from Ethan. 

"Nope, just go to the benches and wait your turn."

"Alright." 

 I returned to the benches with the card in hand but this time, I would be sitting on the benches instead of on the ground. 

Being the last one back, there naturally wasn't many spots left.

Some of the other prospective students were looking at me while others were looking at Ethan. 

I seated myself near the back where there was a spot relatively close to the edge of the benches.

As I sat down, Ethan began his speech once again. 

"Now that you all have an order card in hand, I would like to officially begin our entrance exams. would colours red, white, blue and yellow please come up."

I guess this is what he meant when Ethan said with the order.

I looked down at my card and It had a green circle on it. 

I guess it's not my turn. 

Looking around, 8 people stood up from among the crowds and made their way to Ethan and then onto the platforms. 

Once all 8 examinee were on the platforms in pairs of 2, Ethan called out his signal to begin.

"Begin when ready." Ethan boomed.
