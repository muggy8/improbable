# The Examenee

After completing the grueling task of convincing Phanna to take the exam, I left the room, with food tray in hand, and went back out to the living room.

"How'd it go?" Ethan asked.

"Don't you know the answer to that question already?" I asked back.

I knew that Ethan was listening in to our conversation since I've caught him doing that a few times before.

Ethan's response to my question was also more or less what I expected.

"Oh um... hehe" Ethan fidgeted while looking away from me.

"Ethan, remeber what I have taught you. This isn't how you go about collecting information." I sighed.

"R-Right!" Ethan snapped. 

I know Ethan isn't suited for the front lines despite being a student of mine so I didn't continue this topic much further as there's were other things I wanted to talk to him about.

I walked over to the kitchen area by the fireplace at the corner of the living room and placed the tray into a bucket of water there.

The amount of random stuff in the kitchen area has grown significantly ever since I started trying out Phanna's strange receipes.

Many of the things here, I wouldn't even have consider eating unless I was extremely desprate during a field mission.

I activated the Vibration ability targeting the bucket of water and the tray and the uneaten bits and pieces quickly fell away from the tray.

Ethan was observing me as I did this.

"I'm glad you still use my little cleaning trick" Ethan said.

"Of course, it saves me quite a bit of time and effort."

This trick was something Ethan passed on to me after he gained his Soprano ability and has saved me countless minutes every time I needed to clean tools.

I took the food tray and returned it to the shelves before I sat down next to Ethan on the sofa.

"Hey Ethan, are you sure it's ok for you to be here all the time and leave the school unatended?" I asked after sitting down

I was worried about the school.

The entrence exams for the next term will start a few days from now so I was sure there was a mountain of work that needed his presence.

I remember from the days when Aurora used to be the principal of the school before she passed.

The weeks leading up to the entrence exams where often the most busy.

The other teachers were all tasked with pre-exam assessment of the exam applicants and the one in charge of managing the whole process was none other than the principal.

Depending on the number of applicants, sometimes, the principal might have to participate in the assessment of applicants too.

That's why I knew Ethan definately didn't have the luxury of being away from his duties for this long.

That was something that didn't sit right with me and Ethan knew that.

I looked sternly into Ethan's eyes.

Ethan took the queue and finally gave me an honest answer.

"Well... I can't say that everything is completely fine... Most things are fine since I've been able to maintain contact with the teachers from here."

I gave Ethan a nod to continue.

"Right now, the only issue we have is a few applicants we can't fit into the assessment schedule. But other than that, everything is moving along fine."

"What about the paper work?" I asked.

"Well no one would care if they're late by a bit so..."

Ethan didn't finish his sentence as I glared at him.

"R-right, I'll get them done on time!" Ethan stuttered.

I let out a sigh as I looked away from him towards the room Phanna's in.

"Think Phanna will get better before the Exam?" I asked signaling that i've accepted his answer.

"I'll make sure of it Master Mikay." Ethan responded firmly. 

"Hmmm I see, then allow me to give you a hand with your pre-exam assessments. After all, I can't let myself be the reason that the exams for next term aren't carried out properly."

Ethan was shocked at my proposal and let out a big smile.

"Yes! I, no we, would be completely honored!"

Ethan quickly activated his communication bracelet and contacted someone who was currently on school grounds.

"Mikay has just offered to help us with the pre-exam assessments!!!" Ethan shouted excitedly into his bracelet but I paid him no mind. 

I don't know how many applicants I'll be nssessing but that was trivial to me at this point.

As long as the exams would end up being properly conducted and the the duties of the school fulfilled, then a few extra applicant assessments were perfectly fine by me.

Ethan spoke into his bracelet for a while before he finally turned to me again. 

"I... I'm sorry Master Mikay but... we aren't able to re-order the assessment schedule this late into the assessment to have you assess the top applicants..." Ethan told me dissapointingly.

"Ethan, please, enough with all this overcomplicating. I said I'd help assess the applicants, I didn't say I would assess the best applicants." I scolded. 

"R-right!" Ethan snapped and began eagerly speaking into his bracelet again. 

Shortly after, Ethan turned his attention to me again.

"Master Mikay, I'm sorry to have to ask to do this for us, but, there's 2 applicants located in the northern mountains."

"Where in the northern mountains?"

"Uhh... Um... right, they're from a tribe of elves that has taken up residence in the northern mountains a year or so ago. They're located around the waterfall region. Both applicants are located there."

"Hmm..." 

Everything Ethan said so far mostly seems normal since tribes move in and out of the region quite often.

Yet still, somehow, it felt like there was more to this story than just that.

And as I suspected, Ethan continued explaining the situation.

"You see, the region around the waterfall in the northern mountains is a highly valued area that many tribes are after. That's why the elves have quite a few warriors defending their territory. They said be ready for an ambush when approaching."

"Still doesn't seem too abnormal to me."

"You see, while these situations aren't uncommon for the Mastery League's schools as a whole, our school currently lacks the manpower to pay them a visit safely and assess the applicants..."

The energy in Ethan's voice weakend as he finished his words.

I had a feeling that Ethan already knew I understood what he was implying; he initinlly considered copletedy ignoring the elves applications. 

Afterall, I was once a teacher at the school and was very farmiliar with it's inner workings.

And honestly, I can't say I blame him.

I had a feeling that Ethan was the only Master in the school and the others teachers are all only Proteges since all of the Masters who were taking care of the school before Ethan were....

Either way, Ethan explained the situation almost perfectly confirmed my suspicion.

Additionally, Ethan himself is almost entirely unfit for front line duties like this.

That said, I felt that a decision like that would be too neglectful of the duties of the school.

That fact particularly annoyed me, and I had a feeling that Ethan knew this.

"I see... and the the applicants are?"

"Right, the two applicants are Amanda and Hannah. Amanda seems rather promissing based on her application. Unfortunatey, I can't say the same for Hannah"

"Got it. Ethan, is there anything else I should know before I head out?"

"M-Master Mikay, you're heading out now?"

"Of course, after dinner time is the prime time for the teachers participating in exam applicant assessment to start heading over to the applicants for their assessment right?"

"I... well... err... no, you're right. I wish you the best of luck." Ethan said as he salutes.

Now that's an action I haven't seen in quite a while.

How nostalgic. 

"Please take good care of Phanna while I'm away." I said as I returned a slightly less energetic salute and departed.

## <center>...<center>

It didn't take me too long to start closing in on the waterfall area in the northern mountains.

I made myself easily visable as I made my high speed approach jumping from treetop to treetop.

I missed the days where I only needed to have a  single instance of strengthen and a single instance of quicken active to move like this.

But the my body just isn't what it used to be.

Leaping off another branch, I was finally was able to make eye contact with the waterfall.

Investigation had been active since long before I reached the base of the mountain and I have yet to notice any active abilities yet.

I was fully confident that my Sphere of Influence was larger than anyone elses here which means my detection radius should trump anyone else's as well.

yet, I have yet to detect any attempts to attack me.

I landed on a branch and took another leap. 

Maybe I should wait for an ambush?

After all, I didn't actually know where around the waterfall the elven colony was.

The elven territorial defenders would surely escort me to their base after surely.

I landed on another branch and activated Defense before dropping down to the forest floor and began walking in the direction of the waterfall.

The waterfall isn't much further than here and walking the rest of the way doesn't seem too bad. 

I studied my eviroment as I walked and concluded that I was already in elven territory.

There weren't much shrubery on the forest floor which allows makes the area walkable yet there's enough small bushes that defenders can easily use for ambush attacks.

I was starting to understand why this location was highly prised by various tribes.

Just then, something got stopped by my Defense ability.

I turned around and noticed a dart on the floor and immediately looked towards the direction it came from.

No abilities active from it's general direction.

"I am..." 

My self introduction was cut short as a group of  elf warriars jumped at me from different directions. 

Various instances of physical type abilities were activated all around me as the group of elves rushed at me.

One glance was all I need to know that they were all using Quicken.

I quickly created a circle of fire around me using Pyromancer hoping to intimide but I didn't really expect it to do too much.

Yet for some reason, the elven attackers all stopped in ther tracks.

Feeling like I had a bit of time, I began my self introdution again.

"I am Master Mikay. I am here on behalf of the Mastery League's school in Mountainpass. I am here to assess the applicants Amanda and Hannah for their elegibility to partake in the school's entrence exam." I announced in a commanding voice.

After my announcement, I could hear whispers heard around me. 

"a master..."

"for real..."

"he's just an old man..."

But shortly after, one person stepped up before me and spoke.

She was probably the one in charge here.

"You claim to be a Master, can you prove it?"

"Can you use Investigate?" I asked in return.

"Yes" she replied.

Sure enough, I could see her deactivating Quicken and activating an Observational type ability.

As she did, she quickly became surprised at what she saw.

"So many abilities at once..." she muttered in shock.

But I didn't give her much thought.

I already had Pyromancer activated to maintain the ring of fire around me so that was one active Innate Ability already.

I activated Forgemaster and extruded a pillar of stone out of the ground beneeth me elevating me above the flames.

Another active  Innate Ability.

As that happened, I activated Twister and around my ring of fire to create a small flame vortex centered around me.

"Th-Three Innate Abilities" the elf leader said in shock.

As the elf leader made her observation, the other elves quickly gathered around her and deactivated their abilities in the process.

I, too, deactivated most of my abilities in return keeping only Investigation active to show no ill intent.

"Master Mikay, sorry for the attack earlier. Please accept our appolegy. I am Patrisha and this is my team."

Patrisha bowed deeply as she spoke then turned to her team and instructed them to return to their tasks while she escorts me to their main camp.

After Patrisha escorted me to the camp, she began giving orders to some of the other elves who were around.

She didn't leave my side so I felt a bit uneasy looking around but I did anyways.

I could tell that this camp wasn't where the main camp. 

For one, it was way too far from the waterfall. second, there were far too few tents around to support a tribe big enough to successfully capture and hold such a large area. 

That's why I concluded that this place was likely an outpost of some kind.

The trees branches seemed to have smooth bark on many areas suggesting that those branches were climbed on often.

Shortly after, a group of elves jumpped down from the tree tops and landed in front of me.

"Hello Master Mikay, myname is Amanda. One of the applicants you have come to test." said one of the girls in the group.

"I am pleased to make your acquantance Master Mikay, I am Hannah, the other applicant." snid another girl standing by Amanda's side.

The two of them looks remarkibly similar, more so than any other elves.

I was curious about why there were quite a few others around when Patrisha spoke up again.

"Master Mikay, I hope it's fine with you but we have a number of others who would like to whitness the pre-exam trials would that be ok with you?"

"Oh. ya that's fine."

“Thank you very much!" Patrisha said as she bowed along with the rest of the elves in the groupd

I turned my attention to wards the Hannah and Amanda as they finished their bow.

"So which one of you would like to go first?"

They were a bit surprised at my question.

"You're going to test us both today?" Amanda asked.

"Doesn't the school perform only one pre-exam trial per day?" Hannah added.

"Well... you're not wrong. But that's mostly for the teacher's don't tire out. As for me, I'm not quiet like the avarage teacher at the school." I replied.

The two took a look at each other for a bit before one of them walked forwards.

it was amanda.

"I'll go first then if you don't mind."

"That's fine. lets begin then. First off, a few short questions." I said as I extruded a stone tablet out of the ground with Forgemaster.

The elves around me whispered as I did this but I paid them no attention. 

"lets start off with something easy. what are the skills you can use."

"Quicken, Strengthen and Investigation" she answered.

As she did, I marked her response down on the stone tablet with Forgemaster. 

"Next question, which are you most farmiliar with?" 

"Quicken"

"How many can you keep active at once and for how long?"

"Two abilities for about 3 minutes and a single one for about 8 minutes."

I asked the questions one after another recording the answers on the stone tablet as I went.

At this point, the questions just came out like pouring water. 

It's as if time just dissapeared as the quesitions went on, one by one.

After the questions were all answered, I quickly snapped out of my daze and placed the stone tablet on the ground and picked up a stick.

"Alright now for the real trial. You ready Amanda?" 

Amanda gave me a nod.

I drew a small circle around me with the stick the tossed it to the side.

"Do whatever you can make me step out of this circle no restrictions. Begin whenever you're ready and quit whenever you feel like" I said as I activated 3 instances of quicken and strengthen as well as Defense.

I can see Patrisha's socked expression as I did this as she has also kept her Inspection ability activated this whole time too.

With my own Inspection still active from before, I was able to see Amanda activating two different physical type abilities as she immediately jumping at me right after. 

Frontal attack to my gut, but I caught her strike in my palm.

A spinning round house kick to follow up, but I caught that one with my forearm.

Her foot bounced off my forearm so she tried a low sweep with her other foot.

But I hopped over with a small jump. 

Incoming back hand chop, but I push righ off it and planted myself on the ground within the cricle again.

A driect tackle against me, but I pushed back and sent her flying in return.
