# The Examenee

After completing the grueling task of convincing Phanna to take the exam, I left the room, with food tray in hand, and went back out to the living room.

"How'd it go?" Ethan asked.

"Don't you know the answer to that question already?" I asked back.

I knew that Ethan was listening in to our conversation since I've caught him doing that a few times before.

Ethan's response to my question was also more or less what I expected.

"Oh um... hehe" Ethan fidgeted while looking away from me.

"Ethan, remeber what I have taught you. This isn't how you go about collecting information." I sighed.

"R-Right!" Ethan snapped. 

I know Ethan isn't suited for the front lines despite being a student of mine so I didn't continue this topic much further as there's were other things I wanted to talk to him about.

I walked over to the kitchen area by the fireplace at the corner of the living room and placed the tray into a bucket of water there.

The amount of random stuff in the kitchen area has grown significantly ever since I started trying out Phanna's strange receipes.

Many of the things here, I wouldn't even have consider eating unless I was extremely desprate during a field mission.

I activated the Vibration ability targeting the bucket of water and the tray and the uneaten bits and pieces quickly fell away from the tray.

Ethan was observing me as I did this.

"I'm glad you still use my little cleaning trick" Ethan said.

"Of course, it saves me quite a bit of time and effort."

This trick was something Ethan passed on to me after he gained his Soprano ability and has saved me countless minutes every time I needed to clean tools.

I took the food tray and returned it to the shelves before I sat down next to Ethan on the sofa.

"Hey Ethan, are you sure it's ok for you to be here all the time and leave the school unatended?" I asked after sitting down

I was worried about the school.

The entrence exams for the next term will start a few days from now so I was sure there was a mountain of work that needed his presence.

I remember from the days when Aurora used to be the principal of the school before she passed.

The weeks leading up to the entrence exams where often the most busy.

The other teachers were all tasked with pre-exam assessment of the exam applicants and the one in charge of managing the whole process was none other than the principal.

Depending on the number of applicants, sometimes, the principal might have to participate in the assessment of applicants too.

That's why I knew Ethan definately didn't have the luxury of being away from his duties for this long.

That was something that didn't sit right with me and Ethan knew that.

I looked sternly into Ethan's eyes.

Ethan took the queue and finally gave me an honest answer.

"Well... I can't say that everything is completely fine... Most things are fine since I've been able to maintain contact with the teachers from here."

I gave Ethan a nod to continue.

"Right now, the only issue we have is a few applicants we can't fit into the assessment schedule. But other than that, everything is moving along fine."

"What about the paper work?" I asked.

"Well no one would care if they're late by a bit so..."

Ethan didn't finish his sentence as I glared at him.

"R-right, I'll get them done on time!" Ethan stuttered.

I let out a sigh as I looked away from him towards the room Phanna's in.

"Think Phanna will get better before the Exam?" I asked signaling that i've accepted his answer.

"I'll make sure of it Master Mikay." Ethan responded firmly. 

"Hmmm I see, then allow me to give you a hand with your pre-exam assessments. After all, I can't let myself be the reason that the exams for next term aren't carried out properly."

Ethan was shocked at my proposal and let out a big smile.

"Yes! I, no we, would be completely honored!"

Ethan quickly activated his communication bracelet and contacted someone who was currently on school grounds.

"Mikay has just offered to help us with the pre-exam assessments!!!" Ethan shouted excitedly into his bracelet but I paid him no mind. 

I don't know how many applicants I'll be nssessing but that was trivial to me at this point.

As long as the exams would end up being properly conducted and the the duties of the school fulfilled, then a few extra applicant assessments were perfectly fine by me.

Ethan spoke into his bracelet for a while before he finally turned to me again. 

"I... I'm sorry Master Mikay but... we aren't able to re-order the assessment schedule this late into the assessment to have you assess the top applicants..." Ethan told me dissapointingly.

"Ethan, please, enough with all this overcomplicating. I said I'd help assess the applicants, I didn't say I would assess the best applicants." I scolded. 

"R-right!" Ethan snapped and began eagerly speaking into his bracelet again. 

Shortly after, Ethan turned his attention to me again.

"Master Mikay, I'm sorry to have to ask to do this for us, but, there's 2 applicants located in the northern mountains."

"Where in the northern mountains?"

"Uhh... Um... right, they're from a tribe of elves that has taken up residence in the northern mountains a year or so ago. They're located around the waterfall region. Both applicants are located there."

"Hmm..." 

Everything Ethan said so far mostly seems normal since tribes move in and out of the region quite often.

Yet still, somehow, it felt like there was more to this story than just that.

And as I suspected, Ethan continued explaining the situation.

"You see, the region around the waterfall in the northern mountains is a highly valued area that many tribes are after. That's why the elves have quite a few warriors defending their territory. They said be ready for an ambush when approaching."

"Still doesn't seem too abnormal to me."

"You see, while these situations aren't uncommon for the Mastery League's schools as a whole, our school currently lacks the manpower to pay them a visit safely and assess the applicants..."

I had a feeling that Ethan already knew I understood what he was implying; he initinlly considered copletedy ignoring the elves applications. 

I can't say I blame him.

I had a feeling that Ethan was the only Master in the school and the others teachers are all only Proteges.

The way Ethan explained almost perfectly confirms that.

Additionally, Ethan himself is almost entirely unfit for front line duties like this.

That said, I felt that a decision like that would be too neglectful of the duties of the school.

That fact particularly annoyed me.

"That's"
