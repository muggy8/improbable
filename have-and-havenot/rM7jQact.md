# The Examinee

After completing the grueling task of convincing Phanna to take the exam, I left the room.

Holding the food tray in one hand, I went back to the living room.

“How’d it go?” Ethan asked.

“Don’t you know the answer to that question already?” I asked back.

I knew that Ethan was eavesdropping on our conversation since I’ve caught him doing that a few times before.

Ethan’s response to my question was more or less what I expected.

“Oh um… hehe,” Ethan fidgeted while looking away from me.

“Ethan, remember what I have taught you. This isn’t how you go about collecting information.” I sighed.

“R-Right!” Ethan snapped.

I know Ethan isn’t suited for the front lines despite being a student of mine so I didn’t pursue this topic further.

I walked over to the kitchen area by the fireplace at the corner of the living room and placed the tray into a bucket of water.

The amount of random stuff in the kitchen area has grown significantly ever since I started trying out Phanna’s strange recipes.

Many of the things here, I wouldn’t even have considered eating them unless I was extremely desperate during a field mission.

I activated the Vibration ability targeting the bucket of water and the tray.

Soon enough, the uneaten bits and pieces of food quickly fell away from the tray.

Ethan was observing me as I did this.

“I’m glad you still use my little cleaning trick,” Ethan said.

“Of course, it saves me quite a bit of time and effort.”

This trick was something Ethan passed on to me after he gained his Soprano ability as it saved me countless minutes every time I needed to clean the tools.

I took the clean food tray out of the water and placed it on the shelves before I sat down next to Ethan on the sofa.

“Hey Ethan, are you sure it’s ok for you to be here all the time and leave the school unattended?” I asked after sitting down as I was worried about the school.

The entrance exams for the next term will be taking place a few days from now so I was sure there will be a mountain of work that he needed to do.

I remembered it from the days when Aurora used to be the principal of the school before her passing.

The weeks leading up to the entrance exams were often the busiest.

The other teachers were all tasked with performing pre-exam assessments on the exam applicants.

The one in charge of managing this whole process was none other than the principal.

Depending on the number of applicants, sometimes, the principal might even have to participate in the assessment of applicants.

That’s why I knew Ethan didn’t have the luxury of being away from his duties for this long.

That was something that didn’t sit right with me and Ethan knew that too.

I looked sternly into Ethan’s eyes.

Ethan took the queue and finally gave me an honest answer.

“Well… I can’t say that everything is completely fine… Most things are fine since I’ve been able to maintain contact with the other teachers from here.”

I gave Ethan a nod to continue.

“Right now, the only issue we have is to manage a few applicants we can’t fit into the assessment schedule. But other than that, everything is moving along fine.”

“What about the paperwork?” I asked.

“Well, no one would care if they’re late by a bit so…”

Ethan didn’t finish his sentence as I glared at him.

“R-right, I’ll get them done on time!” Ethan stuttered.

I let out a sigh as I looked away from him towards the room Phanna’s residing.

“Think Phanna will get better before the Exam?” I asked signaling that I’ve accepted his answer.

“I’ll make sure of it Master Mikay,” Ethan responded firmly.

“Hmmm I see, then allow me to give you a hand with your pre-exam assessments. After all, I can’t let myself be the reason that the exams for next term aren’t carried out properly.”

Ethan was shocked at my proposal and let out a big smile.

“Yes! I, no we, would be completely honored!”

Ethan quickly activated his communication bracelet and contacted someone who was currently on school grounds.

“Mikay has just offered to help us with the pre-exam assessments!!!” Ethan shouted excitedly into his bracelet but I paid him no mind.

I don’t know how many applicants I’ll be assessing but that was trivial to me at this point.

As long as the exams would end up being properly conducted and the duties of the school fulfilled, then a few extra applicant assessments were perfectly fine by me.

Ethan spoke into his bracelet for a while before he finally turned to me again.

“I… I’m sorry Master Mikay but… we aren’t able to re-order the assessment schedule this late into the assessment process to allow you to assess the top applicants…” Ethan told me disappointingly.

“Ethan, please, enough with all this over-complicating. I said I’d help assess the applicants, I didn’t say I would assess the best applicants.” I scolded.

“R-right!” Ethan snapped and began eagerly speaking into his bracelet again.

Shortly after, Ethan turned his attention to me again.

“Master Mikay, I’m sorry to have to ask you to do this for us, but, there are 2 applicants located in the northern mountains.”

“Where in the northern mountains?”

“Uhh… Um… right, they’re from a tribe of elves that have taken up residence in the northern mountains a year or so ago. They’re located around the waterfall region. Both applicants are located there.”

“Hmm…”

Everything Ethan said so far mostly seems normal since tribes move in and out of the region quite often.

Yet still, somehow, it felt like there was more to this story than just that.

And as I suspected, Ethan continued explaining the situation.

“You see, the region around the waterfall in the northern mountains is a highly valued area that many tribes are after. That’s why the elves have quite a few warriors defending their territory. They said to be ready for an ambush when approaching.”

“Still doesn’t seem too abnormal to me.”

“You see, while these situations aren’t uncommon for the Mastery League’s schools as a whole, our school currently lacks the manpower to pay them a visit safely and assess the applicants…”

The energy in Ethan’s voice weakened as he finished his words.

I had a feeling that Ethan already knew I understood what he was implying; he initially considered completely ignoring the elves' applications.

After all, I was once a teacher at the school and was very familiar with its inner workings.

And honestly, I can’t say I blame him.

I had a feeling that Ethan was the only Master in the school and the other teachers are all only Proteges since all of the Masters who were taking care of the school before Ethan were…

Either way, Ethan’s explanation of the situation almost confirmed my suspicion.

Additionally, Ethan himself is almost entirely unfit for front-line duties like this.

That said, I felt that a decision like that would be too neglectful for the duties of the school.

That fact particularly annoyed me, and I had a feeling that Ethan knew this.

“I see… and then the applicants are?”

“Right, the two applicants are Amanda and Hannah. Amanda seems rather promising based on her application. Unfortunately, I can’t say the same for Hannah”

“Got it. Ethan, is there anything else I should know before I head out?”

“M-Master Mikay, you’re heading out now?”

“Of course, after dinner is the prime time for the teachers participating in exam applicant assessments to start heading over to where the applicants are located and perform these assessments right?”

“I… well… err… no, you’re right. I wish you the best of luck.” Ethan said with a salute.

Now that’s an action I haven’t seen in quite a while.

How nostalgic.

“Please take good care of Phanna while I’m away,” I said as I returned a slightly less energetic salute and departed.

It didn’t take me too long to start closing in on the waterfall area in the northern mountains.

I made myself easily visible as I made my high-speed approach jumping from one treetop to another.

I missed the days where I only needed to have a single instance of Strengthen and a single instance of Quicken active to move like this.

But my body just isn’t what it used to be.

Leaping off another branch, I was finally able to catch sight of the waterfall.

Investigation had been active since long before I reached the base of the mountain but I have yet to notice any other active abilities.

I was fully confident that my Sphere of Influence was larger than anyone else’s here which means my detection radius should trump anyone else’s as well.

But somehow, I have not detected any attempts to attack me yet.

I landed on a branch and took another leap.

Maybe I should wait for an ambush?

After all, I didn’t know where around the waterfall the elven base was located.

The elven territorial defenders would surely escort me to their base afterward.

I landed on another branch and activated Defense before dropping down to the forest floor as I had planned on walking the rest of the distance to the waterfall.

The waterfall isn’t much further from here and walking the rest of the way doesn’t seem too bad.

I studied my environment as I walked and concluded that I was already in elven territory.

There wasn’t much shrubbery on the forest floor which makes the area walkable yet there are enough small bushes that defenders can easily use for ambushing attacks.

I was starting to understand why this location was highly prised by numurous tribes.

Just then, something got stopped by my Defense ability.

I turned around and noticed a dart on the floor and immediately looked towards the direction it came from.

No abilities were active from its general direction.

“I am…”

My self-introduction was cut short as a group of elf warriors jumped at me from different directions.

Various instances of physical type abilities were activated all around me as the group of elves rushed at me.

One glance was all I need to know that they were all using Quicken.

I quickly created a circle of fire around me using Pyromancer hoping to intimidate them but I didn’t expect it to do too much.

Yet for some reason, the elven attackers all stopped in their tracks.

Feeling like I had a bit of time, I began my self-introduction again.

“I am Master Mikay. I am here on behalf of the Mastery League’s school in Mountain Pass. I am here to assess the applicants Amanda and Hannah for their eligibility to partake in the school’s entrance exam.” I announced in a commanding voice.

After my announcement, I could hear whispers all around me.

“a master…”

“for real…”

“he’s just an old man…”

But shortly after, one person stepped up to me and spoke.

She was probably the one in charge here.

“You claim to be a Master, can you prove it?”

“Can you use Investigation?” I asked in return.

“Yes,” she replied.

Sure enough, I could see her deactivating Quicken and activating an Observational type ability.

As she did, she quickly became surprised at what she saw.

“So many abilities at once…” she muttered in shock.

But I didn’t give her much thought.

I already had Pyromancer activated to maintain the ring of fire around me so that was one Innate Ability already activated.

I also activated Forgemaster and extruded a pillar of stone out of the ground beneath me to elevate me above the flames.

Another active Innate Ability.

As that happened, I activated Twister around my ring of fire to create a small flame vortex centered around me.

“Th-Three Innate Abilities,” the elf leader said in shock.

As the elf leader made her observation, the other elves quickly gathered around her while deactivating their abilities in the meanwhile.

I, too, deactivated most of my abilities in return keeping only Investigation active to show no ill intent.

“Master Mikay, sorry for the attack earlier. Please accept our apology. I am Patrisha and this is my team.”

Patrisha bowed deeply as she spoke then turned to her team and instructed them to return to their tasks while she escorted me to their main camp.

After Patrisha escorted me to the camp, she began giving orders to some of the other elves around her.

She didn’t leave my side so I felt a bit uneasy looking around but it didn't stop me from doing that anyway.

I could tell that this camp wasn’t the main camp.

For one, it was way too far from the waterfall. Second, there were far too few tents around to support a tribe big enough to successfully capture and hold such a large area.

That’s why I concluded that this place was likely an outpost of some kind.

The tree branches here seemed to have smooth bark on many areas suggesting that those branches were climbed on often.

Shortly after, a group of elves jumped down from the treetops and landed in front of me.

“Hello Master Mikay, my name is Amanda. One of the applicants you have come to test,” said one of the girls in the group.

“I am pleased to make your acquaintance Master Mikay, I am Hannah, the other applicant,” said another girl standing beside Amanda.

The two of them look remarkably similar, more so than any other elves.

I was curious about why there were quite a few others around when Patrisha spoke up again.

“Master Mikay, I hope it’s fine with you but we have several others who would like to witness the pre-exam trials. Would that be ok with you?”

“Ohh. yeah, that’s fine.”

“Thank you very much!” Patrisha said as she bowed along with the rest of the elves in the group

I turned my attention towards Hannah and Amanda as they finished their bow.

“So which one of you would like to go first?”

They were a bit surprised at my question.

“You’re going to test us both today?” Amanda asked.

“Doesn’t the school perform only one pre-exam trial per day?” Hannah added.

“Well… you’re not wrong. But that’s mostly to prevent the teachers from tiring out. As for me, I’m not quite like the average teacher at the school,” I replied.

The two looked at each other for a bit before one of them walked forwards.

It was Amanda.

“I’ll go first then if you don’t mind.”

“That’s fine. Let’s begin then. First off, a few short questions,” I said as I extruded a stone tablet out of the ground with Forgemaster.

The elves around me whispered as I did this but I paid them no attention.

“Let’s start off with something easy. What are the skills you can use?”

“Quicken, Strengthen and Investigation,” she answered.

As soon as she replied, I marked her response down on the stone tablet with Forgemaster.

“Next question, which ability are you most familiar with?”

“Quicken”

“How many can you keep active at once and for how long?”

“Two abilities for about 3 minutes and a single one for about 8 minutes.”

I continued to ask questions one after another and recorded the answers on the stone tablet as I kept going on.

At this point, the questions just came out like flowing water.

It’s as if time just disappeared as the questions went on, one by one.

After all the questions were answered, I quickly snapped out of my daze and placed the stone tablet on the ground, and I picked up a stick instead.



“Alright now for the real trial. You ready, Amanda?”

Amanda gave me a nod.

I drew a small circle around me with the stick then tossed it to the side.

“Do whatever you can to make me step out of this circle, no restrictions. Begin whenever you’re ready and quit whenever you feel like,” I said as I activated 3 instances of each of Quicken, Strengthen, and Defense.

I can see Patrisha’s shocked expression as I did this for she has also kept her Inspection ability activated this whole time too.

With my Inspection still active from before, I was able to see Amanda activating two different physical type abilities as she immediately jumped at me right after that she did a frontal attack to my gut, but I caught her strike in my palm.

It was followed by a spinning roundhouse kick, but I caught that one with my forearm.

Her foot bounced off my forearm so she tried a low sweep with her other foot.

But I hopped over with a small jump.

She launched an incoming backhand chop, but I push right off it and planted myself on the ground within the circle again.

In return, she did a direct tackle against me, but I pushed backward and sent her flying in return.

Not willing to give up, Amanda got up immediately and tried again, this time, with different tactics.

Of course, that didn’t change much and she ended up flying again.

This continued again and again for almost an hour until she finally gave up with scratches, scrapes, and bruises all over her body.

Amanda looked like she could hardly get up.

Honestly, I felt bad for her but I had to do what I must.

She lasted longer than I had expected.

Most applicants only try when they can keep their abilities active and only for a couple of ability activation rounds.

I picked up the stone tablet again and noted down my thoughts before creating another one with Forgemaster.

I looked towards Hannah.

“Ready?” I asked.

“Yes,” said Hannah looking a bit intimidated but she made her way to me anyway.

“Alright, let’s begin with the questions then,” I said.

Hannah answered with a nod.

The questioning process was very similar to Amanda’s questioning session and many of her answers were similar too.

And then, the physical test, the same Physical test I had Amanda done.

Hannah was shaking nervously when I told her the rules but she quickly shook it off and made her attempt at pushing me out of the circle.

In almost all regards, she was like a weaker version of Amanda.

Hanna can keep 2 abilities active at once, yes, but for a far shorter time than Amanda.

Her single ability activation duration wasn’t that long either and she gave up around 10 minutes in the course of her trial.

Hannah wasn’t in the best shape but compared to Amanda, Hannah was practically unscathed.

I noted down my thoughts on her stone tablet and picked up Amanda’s stone tablet.

I waved to Patrisha once I was done noting down my thoughts but she was talking to someone on the side.

Thinking that she was probably giving orders to someone, I decided to wait a bit until she was done.

I could return home on my own but it felt a bit awkward just leaving like this so I continued to wait.

Soon, Patrisha was done talking and came over to me.

Beside her was another elf girl who was the first to speak up.

“Um… M-master Mikay… i-is it too late for me to apply as well?” she asked.

I looked at this shy girl and something about her reminded me of Ethan.

She had a piece of tree bark in her hands and she was shivering with fear.

“Sure why not,” I said taking the tree bark from her hands.

The name 'Melody' was writteo on it.

Her name was carved into the inside of the bark along with some other application info.

I put her bark and the two tablets from earlier down while creating a third tablet for Melody.

“Well, since I’m here already, let’s get this trial started,” I said.

Melody’s eyes lit up with happiness when I said that.

“What are the skills you can use?”

“Quicken, Strengthen, Investigation, heat and cool,” she answered.

“Which ability are you most familiar with?”

“Quicken.”

“How many can you keep active at once and for how long?”

“One ability for about 4 minutes…”

…

Like with Amanda and Hannah before. I continued to ask my questions and marked down Melody’s responses.

And like with the previous two, I had place the tablet down after and stood in the circle; as I asked Melody to try and push me out.

Melody took a deep breath and came at me flailing.

Her form was awful, no doubt about that.

Her hits were pitiful too despite her using Quicken.

Though despite that, she had a rare talent.

She was able to change her ability so fast that she appeared to be using two abilities.

I noticed that she was using Quicken to accelerate her approach, then, switching to the Heat or Cool ability when she was at striking distance.

However, she wasn’t in contact with me long enough for this to work on me.

By the 20 minute mark, Melody has fully used up her third ability activation duration and is now charging at me with none of the abilities active.

I had fully expected her to give up right around here but she kept coming.

By 40 minutes, Melody was looking like she was just as bad in shape as Amanda was by this time or maybe, even worse.

Melody seemed like she could barely stand up but she kept coming.

She had no abilities active anymore at this point yet somehow she kept charging and charging.

I caught her last tackle, took a step back, and held on to her gently but she tried her best to shake me off.

“Melody, stop,” I said.

But she didn’t.

“Melody, look down, stop,” I said again.

And she did.

My heel was outside of the circle.

“D-Did I do well?” she asked.

“Yes, yes you did,” I answered.

She tried as best she could.

This too reminded me of Ethan.

I remember I did the same thing to Ethan when performing his pre-exam trials.

I felt like his life was in danger if he kept trying but he did.

At that point, I had no choice but to let him win.

Melody too.

This girl will probably go far.

I carried Melody to Patrisha before I noted down my thoughts on the stone tablet.

After that, Patrisha came up to me with a concerned look on her face.

“Is Melody Ok?” She asked.

“Not sure, but I can return tomorrow with a healer if you don’t have a healer in your camp,” I answered.

“N-no that’s quite alright, we have healers in the camp to help out too. I’m just worried about Melody,” Patrisha continued.

“About?”

“Well… I just had a bad feeling when I was watching the fight just now. You know, I felt like Melody might die.”

“I know how you feel because I felt the same. that’s why I stepped out of the circle.”

“I… I see… What about the exams? Those are fights against other people who aren’t teachers. I’m really worried that Melody might get herself killed like she almost did now,” Patrisha plead.

“Don’t worry about that, we have plenty of teachers on-site to stop anything before it gets too bad. Also, killing innocent people is the fastest way to lose an insane amount of karma. In fact, death by karma becomes a real concern for most people at this point. That’s why no one in their right mind would do that.”

“R-right…”

“Don’t worry, just leave it to the teachers at the school,” I said reassuringly.

“You’re right Master Mikay,” Patrisha said looking a bit relieved.

“Will you be leaving now Master Mikay?” Patrisha asked after gaining her composure.

“Yes,” I replied.

“I see, let me walk you to the edge of our territory.”

“Thanks.”

## <center>...<center>

By the time I got home, Ethan had already passed out.

It was too dark, so dark in fact that I had to light the way home with the fire created by Pyromancer.

I placed the stack of stone tablets and Melody’s application tree bark on the ground in front of Ethan as I went off to bed myself.

For some reason, Phanna was still awake and tormenting Pillow.

Seeing this, I started getting the feeling that Phanna was probably nocturnal.

That’d be bad…
