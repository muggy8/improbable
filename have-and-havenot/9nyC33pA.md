# Astronomical Odds

"Thanks for holding down the fort, Pillow" I said as I awaken from my mid day nap in my late wife's room

The room is unusually clean today as I had spent all morning cleaning this place up.

The bed I am currently sleeping on is positioned by the wall of the door and the wall to the left of the door.

It does seems that this is a good place to position this bed as this room didn't have a bed in here just a few days ago. 

I've been moving the bed around to test out different places that would fit nicely but as expected in the corrner is definately still the best option. 

I leaned towards my pet Slime who's lazing around on the ground next to my bed and began poking at it's silky smooth surface. 

"Still nothing?" I asked as if expecting a reply but who am I kidding, Pillow's a slime blob with no way of communicating. It can't possibly reply.

Though that may be the case, having it on watch is probably still a good idea since it'll surly cause a ruckus if someone did show up.

Or so I had thought as I looked over to the aquarium placed by the wall directly across from the door of the room fully expecting it to be empty only to find a slender person sleeping there.

Pillow normally lives in that aquarium and swims around happily within it but a few days earlier, I had the aquarium drained to prepair for the summoning ritual.

After draining and cleaning the aquarium, I inscribed a summoning inscriptions onto it as I had done before with the usual conditions.

Well, only sort of the same as usual. I had no idea how well things will work out this time around since summoning rituals aren't normally done inside an aquarium.

Unfortunately, the last person I summoned passed away shortly and seemed to have mentioned something about vaccination or quarantine before he died.

I'm not sure what either of those things are but I thought I should at least set up a safe space for the summoned this time around. Maybe it'll boost the odds of survival.

That's why I had no idea how long the summoning ritual will last for or if it'll even work at all because of how strangely the summoning ritual was performed.

But to my surprise, it looks like the summoning ritual had worked normally.  Nothing was too out of the ordinary... the only problem is that this one doesn't seem like any humanoid I've ever seen...

This one's got long pointy ears growing where normal humans would have ears. In fact, these ears are so similar to the ears of an elf that I would have just assued I had summoned an elf had it not been for the other set of black fox like ears that seems to blend right into the summoned's shiny black hair.

This is the first time I've ever seen such a strange setup in any humanoid ever but that's really not much of a concern to me.

...

After inspecting the summoned for a while, I turned around and looked over to Pillow who's lazing around as usual.

"Hey Pillow~ Did you know? someone's invaded your room? Why didn't you tell me about it~?" I asked Pillow playfully.

Of course, no response as usual, though I did get a jiggle out of it when I called it's name.

Thinking about it, I haven't really fed Pillow in a few days now so maybe it's just low on energy? But aren't you only supposed to feed a slime once a week?

Maybe a bit of food will help it out.

Thinking this, I picked Pillow up and placed it inside a glass garbage bin.

"Eat up Pillow."

In a short while Pillow's smooth and silky exterior changed to become slimy and sticky.

Things it touched got pulled into it's body and pretty soon, all the trash in the bin got consumed and Pillow returned to it's original smooth and silky state.

I lifted Pillow out of the trash bin and caught sight of the summoned sitting up inside the aquarium.

I walked over to the aquarium making sure to make my presence known.

The last time I approached carelessly, I got accused of being a "jump scare".

I don't know what that is but it definitely doesn't sound like something I'd want to get associated with.
