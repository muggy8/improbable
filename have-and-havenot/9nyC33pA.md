# Name

"Thanks for holding down the fort, Pillow" I said to my pet companion as I awakened from my mid day nap.

The wooden room I woke up in belonged to my late wife.

I've been using it as a storage room for some time now but recently, I've been cleaning it up again which is why it's unusually clean today.

The bed I am currently sleeping on is positioned next to both the wall of the door and the wall to the left of the door.

It does seem that this is the best place to position this bed.

I've been moving the bed around to test out different places that would fit nicely, but as expected, in the corner is definitely still the best option.

I leaned towards my pet slime, Pillow, who was lazing around on the ground next to my bed and began poking at it's silky smooth surface.

"Still nothing?" I asked as if expecting a reply but who am I kidding, Pillow's a slime blob with no way of communicating. It can't possibly reply.

Though that may be the case, having fit on which is probably still a good idea since it'll surely cause a ruckus if someone did show up.

Or so I had thought as I looked over to the aquarium that was located by the wall directly across from the door of the room.

I was fully expecting it to be empty but I noticed a slender person sleeping in there.

Pillow normally lives in that aquarium and swims around happily within it but a few days earlier, I had the aquarium drained to prepare for the summoning ritual.

After draining and cleaning the aquarium, I inscribed the summoning inscriptions onto it as I had done before with the usual cry for help.

Well, only sort of the same as usual. I had no idea how well things will work out this time around since summoning rituals aren't normally done inside an aquarium.

Unfortunately, the last person I summoned died shortly after being summoned and seemed to have mentioned something about vaccination or quarantine before he died.

I'm not sure what either of those things are but I thought I should at least set up a safe space for the summoned this time around. Maybe it'll boost the odds of survival.

That's why I had no idea how long the summoning ritual will last for, or, if it'll even work at all because of the abnormal circumstances of the summoning this time around.

But to my surprise, it looks like the summoning ritual had worked normally. Nothing was too out of the ordinary… the only problem is that this one doesn't seem like any humanoid I've ever seen… If that can be considered a problem at all.

This one's got long pointy ears growing where normal humans would have ears. In fact, these ears are so similar to elf ears that I would have just assumed that I had summoned an elf had it not been for the other set of black fox like ears that seems to blend right into the summoned's shiny black hair.

This is the first time I've ever seen such a strange setup in any humanoid ever. 

Though if this person is a Chimera, it would totally explain the appearent fox like ears on the body of, what would other wise have been, a mostly normal looking elf.

That said, what kind of world would a Chimera like this come from? I've only ever heard of Chimeras in legends.

…

After inspecting the summoned for a while, I turned around and looked over to Pillow who was lazing around as usual.

"Hey Pillow~ Did you know? someone's invaded your room? Why didn't you tell me about it~?" I asked playfully.

Of course, no response as usual, though I did get a jiggle out of it when I called its name.

Thinking about it, I haven't really fed Pillow in a few days so maybe it's just low on energy? But aren't you only supposed to feed a slime once a week?

Maybe a bit of food will help it out.

Thinking this, I picked Pillow up and placed it inside a glass garbage bin by the table that's across from the bed.

"Eat up Pillow."

In a short while Pillow's smooth and silky exterior changed to become slimy and sticky.

Things it touched got pulled into its body and pretty soon, all the trash in the bin got consumed and Pillow returned to it's original smooth and silky state.

I lifted Pillow out of the trash bin and caught sight of the summoned sitting up inside the aquarium.

I walked over to the aquarium making sure to make my presence known.

The last time I approached carelessly, I got accused of being a "jump scare".

I don't know what that is, but it definitely doesn't sound like something I'd want to get associated with.

"Hi there my name is Mikay, how are you feeling?" I introduced.

I didn't really get much of a response as the summoned looked around sleepily before looking back over to me with the same sleepy expression.

The only way I can describe the summoned's movement and expression is with the words "half dead".

"I guess we're in that kind of simulation now…" the Summoned Muttered.

I wasn't exactly sure what to expect with this comment but it definitely didn't feel right.

What exactly is a simulation anyways?

I noticed summoned looking at the horn sticking out of the middle of my forehead and blinking emptily.

"If you're wondering about my horn, I'm an Ogre. I'm the single horn type."

"Oh… is that so."

"Um… Ok… So what type are you? I've never seen ears like yours before."

"Me? Just a human? I guess my taxonomical species is 4ACF3567YH3G"

…

There wasn't a hint of sarcasm in the way the summoned delivered that line.

I'm not exactly sure if the summoned is lying or joking or something else but I can't see any reasoning behind it if that's actually what it was.

After all, the summoning ritual only summons people who are willing to be summoned so there shouldn't be any animosity so early on in our relationship.

Ok, let's try something else then.

"What's your name? My name is Mikay, as I mentioned earlier."

"Name…?" said the summoned with an unsure tone.

You can't be serious right?

The summoned didn't seem to know how to answer the question.

I mean, how does a village even function without names?

As I was pondering this, the summoned spoke up again.

"My universal Identification Code is A244X0Z4305PHAN4"

"A2… What? How?"

"It's A244X0Z4305PHAN4"

"A name like that doesn't seem practical at all," I said in bewilderment.

"Is it? It's been working out just fine for me so far. And besides, I didn't say it was a name, I said it was my Universal Identification Code."

"Uni-what?"

"Universal Identification Code, It's a number that's used as an identification code and is mathematically guaranteed to be unique within the observable universe."

I stared blankly back… something's not right and I wasn't exactly sure what to feel.

And to top it off, that statement made way too little sense to me.

Still, though, I was not quite sure what I was supposed to call the summoned so I once again began my questioning.

"So… what am I supposed to call you?"

"Probably just 4 then?" said 4 with an uninterested expression and still without any hint of sarcasm.

"Uhh… What? Where did that come from?"

"It's the smallest number of my Universal Identification Code. I can call you K too since it's easier."

"Ok, hold on a second here, I don't know what your deal is but you can't just go around naming other people."

"But I'm not naming you. All I'm doing is using the most concise way of addressing you."

"Huh???"

I gave 4 a confused look and unsurprisingly, I got one back in return.

"Look, I just need a reasonable thing to call you, is that just too much to ask?"

"4 seems pretty reasonable to me." 4 said again without a hint of sarcasm.

I'm truly not sure how I felt about this.

The conversation I'm having with 4 is really just going nowhere and the tone in 4's voice sounded completely hollow as if there's no soul behind any of the words that were spoken.

Honestly, I can only describe this conversation as both passive and aggressive. Maybe that should be a new word or phrase or something.

That said, there's definitely some kind of unwillingness to, well, do anything behind 4's words and tone thus far. However, there shouldn't be any reason for the summoned to be like this.

The summoning ritual is supposed to only call forth those who are willing to cooperate so considering how uncooperative 4 has been thus far, I can only really call it a failure.

Maybe this is why summoning rituals were exclusively performed in rooms instead of aquariums since an uncooperative summon is a pretty hefty price to pay.

In fact, I was starting to feel unsure about if this whole summoning thing succeeded at all going by what little conversation that I and the summoned had had.

However, I didn't really have anything to lose by continuing this conversation. Honestly, at the very least, I should get a proper name out of 4 so I at least have a name to use when thinking back on the current series of events in the future.

That was what happened to my previous summon. Since his accent was so thick, I wasn't really able to understand half the stuff he said. In fact, I couldn't even catch his name before he fell ill and once the illness set in, any hope of getting a name out of him was gone.

I started imagining a future scenario where I had to recount the events of right now and of my recent past and the prospect of having to use Unnamed Summon #1 and Unnamed Summon #2 to explain who did what and what happened to whom.

Yah, that's definitely not going to work out. Having 1 unnamed summon is already one too many already.

That's why I decided to continue questioning the current summoned despite me pretty much already labelling this summoning a failure.

"What do people normally call you in your homeworld?"

"Mostly N4 or AN4 since it's too easy to get who's who mixed up when using just 1 number to address people."

"Then why did you tell me to call you 4 earlier?"

"4 is the smallest number in my Universal Identification Code that can be used to uniquely identify one of us when it's just the 2 of us in a conversation."

"Right, and you just add more characters to the name as the need arises? But why from the back?"

"Actually, my Universal Identification Code is a number, a base 36 number."

"A what?"

4 sighed and began speaking again and for the first time, there was an emotion accompanying the voice; the emotion of annoyance.

"What's the biggest single digit number?"

"9"

"Uh… sure…? Anyways, for a second imagine that 10 was a single digit number, let say using the letter A. If we do that 1A would functionally be 21 right?"

"What?"

I gave 4 a confused look and quickly looked down at the palm of my hand to run through the scenario.

If the number A was the same as the number 10 then the number 10 under this scenario would be the same as 11 right? That would mean 10 + A would make 1A which is the be the same as 11 + 10 and yah that would indeed make 21.

After confirming this, I looked back up.

"Well, if you put it that way sure but I don't see where this is going." I said with skepticism.

"Right, now imagine if you can represent any number up to 35 with a single digit by using this system. start from 0 to 9 and then from A to Z. You get it now?"

Struck with newfound understanding, I immediately looked down again at my palm trying to figure out what 4's code thing would translate to but I honestly can't even remember anything past AN4 now.

As I thought this, 4 spoke up again

"Don't worry too much about what the base 10 number my Universal Identification Code would translate to. All you have to know is that my Universal Identification Code is a number, and that the smallest sub number that is unique to an individual while they are within a group is what gets used for the purpose of addressing that individual"

After hearing this, I started to feel a bit bad for 4.

I mean, a world where names are literally just numbers? What sort of hell world is this?

"Have you ever wanted a proper name?" I asked.

"Not really, some people from my world really liked that concept and even took up names themselves but I don't really see the need for it. And besides, it just makes things more complicated. Just imagine if there was someone else here called Mikay"

"Well, I can't keep calling you 4. I can't even remember your code thing past AN4."

"Then just remember PHAN4. That number uniquely identifies me in the continental region I once lived in."

"PHAN4… Do you mind if I give you a name? PHAN4 is just too much of a mouthful to say"

"Sure, do whatever, not like I'm going to be addressing myself anytime soon."

"Right, so how does Phanna sound to you as a name?"

"Sure, call me whatever you want" Phanna said with a shrug and in the emotionless flat tone.

I guess there's at least a usable name I can use for Phanna now.

I mean I still can't imagine what a world without names is like and how different it'd be too.

Maybe I shouldn't call Phanna a failure just yet.

After finally settling the matter of what to call Phanna, I really need to settle the next most important thing on my to do list.

It might not work but at the very least I should give it a try.

"Phanna?"

"Hmm?"

"Would you be willing to help save my daughter?"

Phanna gave me a look of confusion along with a "Wha?"

Should I explain further? I probably should right?

"You see, my daughter was once a Grandmaster of the Mastery League. However, because of my failure as a father and as a Master, My daughter has since forsaken her role as a Grandmaster and she's now in danger of the consequences of this decision." I explained.

However, all I got from Phanna in return was an eye tilt and a whole lot of silence.

I guess the summoning did end in failure.

As far as I know, this is the first time in my knowledge where the summoning ritual called forth someone who's actually unwilling to help.

I even had to permanently give up a portion of my own P-Particles to perform the summoning.

As I thought this, I could feel my facial expression change to match how I feel.

I looked away from Phanna and down at Pillow who's snugly wrapped around my arms.

The current summoning ended in failure, the previous summoning ended in death by illness.

I really didn't have many options left to begin with and just when I thought there was hope when I found the champion summoning ritual, the whole plan started falling apart with 2 back-to-back failures right from the start.

I'm physically able to perform a few more summoning but is that even worth it at this point?

One more would lower the number of P-Particles I have to the range of just above level 4 and at that point, the only thing I can do is to rely on successfully summoning a champion to save my daughter.

But given how risky summoning rituals can be, is it even worth it to continue?

I, again, looked back up at Phanna who's sitting there being lost in thought.

Just as I did that, Phanna seemed to have also noticed my gaze and quickly snapped back to reality and returning my gaze.

"What do you need to save your daughter from anyways? I still don't understand."

I was flabbergasted

Phanna isn't rejecting to help me?

"What do you mean?"

"I don't understand what you mean when you say you need to save your daughter since I still don't quite understand what kind of danger this daughter of yours is in."

"I-I see."

I cleared my throat and began to explain.

"Ok here's the background, there's an organization in our world that maintains order across our lands called the Mastery League. They educate people in the usage and application of Abilities to better the lives of everyone. However, abilities can be used for great good but also great evil. That's why the most powerful ability users are recruited for the purpose of maintaining order across the lands. This was the role my daughter once held. Now, what do you think would happen if one of the League's strongest and most powerful ability user decided to abandon her post?"

"I don't know? Personally, I really wouldn't do anything. People come and go all the time."

"Your world must be incredibly peaceful then."

"Not really, it's actually quite the organized chaos. I mean, as an example, on average, every couple thousand years or so, we have a crazy group of people who decides to engineer a superbug to wipe out all complex biological life and one in every couple thousand of these groups manage to actually succeed for the most part. But it always fails to actually do any lasting damage as some other person or group's anti extinction contingency measures would restart biological life after without fail. It might cause a couple hundred to thousand years of decreased productivity but because technology is never truly lost, eventually, things will return to normal. That's why I really don't see what the big deal is with losing a strong ability user or two."

I was shocked. I didn't know how to respond. I was searching for words to say but all that came out was:

"What?!"

It wasn't the fact that Phanna's homeworld seems like total chaos from what was described but instead, at how Phanna just accepts an event that would end all life to be a natural part of life.

At least that's the gist of what I understood from what Phanna just said.

"You're ok with the complete end of all life?"

"Yes and no I guess. It'd suck to die at the hands of a bio-engineering attack but life as a whole will find a way, life always has and always will."

"D-don't you care about dying?"

"Honestly, If it wasn't for the fact that I'm only 796 years old currently, I'd be dead right now."

Again, I was lost for words.

I didn't know how to respond to this.

Does Phanna have an unfulfilled death wish?

And 796 years old? Is that even possible?

Even if it was, what's with "only 796"?

I didn't believe a single thing that Phanna just said.

I didn't want to.

I couldn't.

I feel like the stuff that Phanna was saying has stopped making sense a long time ago yet somehow I'm still here trying to piece together some semblance of meaning from Phanna's words.

My mind drifted around in it's shattered state unsure of what to do when Phanna spoke up again.

Do I even want to listen?

"So about your daughter…"

Somehow, someway, Phanna managed to bring my mind back to the present.

I shook my head violently trying to clear my mind before finally looking back at Phanna.

"Right. What about my daughter?"

"What sort of danger is she actually in?"

"A-ah right. the Grandmasters in the Guild of Mastery are seen as the protectors of humanity and those who are able to match the Grandmasters in power but isn't a Grandmaster themselves are considered to be a major threat to all of humanity and are therefore known as Phantom Lords. I know that you don't really see that as a problem but in our world, we are absolutely unable to accept the total destruction of all humanity nor do we believe we can recover from such a disaster. That's why all those who are seen as major threats to humanity are hunted down by the Mastery League and that fate is the fate I would like to save my daughter from."

"Oh… that's quite the conundrum you have going on. So what's your plan for saving her from the life of being hunted?"

"I… Uhh… I don't know… I know there's no way I can forcefully return her to the Mastery League as her strength far surpasses mine and even surpasses any other individual Grandmaster. But, I do know that at the very least, I must say sorry to her." I said resolutely.

"So you don't even have a plan…" Phanna said while giving me a disappointing look from within the glass aquarium.

"Unfortunately…"

"I have no reason to turn you down but, you know, it's really hard to accept a request like this with only an objective and no actual plan of action right?"

"…"

I couldn't deny Phanna's accusations.

It was true, I had no real plan at all.

My plan basically ended at summoning a champion and hope that said champion would be able to help me.

I had completely neglected to consider what is to come after.

"Look, Mikay, I really can't help you given everything you've told me so far. I don't even know what rules this world operates on. All I can do for now is to familiarize myself with this world and then, maybe I can come up with some kind of a plan. But if I'm unable to come up with such a plan, unless you come up with a workable plan on your own to save your daughter, there really isn't anything I can do for you."

"I-I see," I said with much disappointment.

It's really not like what Phanna says is unreasonable.

I guess this whole summoning isn't a complete failure.

However, whether or not it's a success is still to be seen.

Though I'm starting to feel rather hopeful about my prospects now.
