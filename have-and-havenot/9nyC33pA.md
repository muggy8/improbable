"Thanks for holding down the fort, Pillow" I said as I awaken from my mid day nap in my late wife's room

The wooden room I woke up in is unusually clean today as I had spent all morning cleaning this place up.

The bed I am currently sleeping on is positioned next to both the wall of the door and the wall to the left of the door.

It does seems that this is the best place to position this bed.

I've been moving the bed around to test out different places that would fit nicely but as expected in the corrner is definately still the best option. 

I leaned towards my pet slime Pillow who was lazing around on the ground next to my bed and began poking at it's silky smooth surface. 

"Still nothing?" I asked as if expecting a reply but who am I kidding, Pillow's a slime blob with no way of communicating. It can't possibly reply.

Though that may be the case, having it on watch is probably still a good idea since it'll surly cause a ruckus if someone did show up.

Or so I had thought as I looked over to the aquarium placed by the wall directly across from the door of the room 

I was fully expecting it to be empty but I noticed a slender person sleeping there.

Pillow normally lives in that aquarium and swims around happily within it but a few days earlier, I had the aquarium drained to prepair for the summoning ritual.

After draining and cleaning the aquarium, I inscribed the summoning inscriptions onto it as I had done before with the usual conditions.

Well, only sort of the same as usual. I had no idea how well things will work out this time around since summoning rituals aren't normally done inside an aquarium.

Unfortunately, the last person I summoned passed away shortly and seemed to have mentioned something about vaccination or quarantine before he died.

I'm not sure what either of those things are but I thought I should at least set up a safe space for the summoned this time around. Maybe it'll boost the odds of survival.

That's why I had no idea how long the summoning ritual will last for or if it'll even work at all because of how abnormal the summoning ritual was this time around.

But to my surprise, it looks like the summoning ritual had worked normally.  Nothing was too out of the ordinary… the only problem is that this one doesn't seem like any humanoid I've ever seen…

This one's got long pointy ears growing where normal humans would have ears. In fact, these ears are so similar to the ears of an elf that I would have just assued I had summoned an elf had it not been for the other set of black fox like ears that seems to blend right into the summoned's shiny black hair.

This is the first time I've ever seen such a strange setup in any humanoid ever but that's really not much of a concern to me.

…

After inspecting the summoned for a while, I turned around and looked over to Pillow who's lazing around as usual.

"Hey Pillow~ Did you know? someone's invaded your room? Why didn't you tell me about it~?" I asked Pillow playfully.

Of course, no response as usual, though I did get a jiggle out of it when I called it's name.

Thinking about it, I haven't really fed Pillow in a few days now so maybe it's just low on energy? But aren't you only supposed to feed a slime once a week?

Maybe a bit of food will help it out.

Thinking this, I picked Pillow up and placed it inside a glass garbage bin by the table that's across from the bed.

"Eat up Pillow."

In a short while Pillow's smooth and silky exterior changed to become slimy and sticky.

Things it touched got pulled into it's body and pretty soon, all the trash in the bin got consumed and Pillow returned to it's original smooth and silky state.

I lifted Pillow out of the trash bin and caught sight of the summoned sitting up inside the aquarium.

I walked over to the aquarium making sure to make my presence known.

The last time I approached carelessly, I got accused of being a "jump scare".

I don't know what that is but it definitely doesn't sound like something I'd want to get associated with. 

"Hi there my name is Mikay, how are you feeling?" I introduced.

I didn't really get much of a responce as the summoned looked around sleepily before looking over to me with the same sleepy experession.

The only way I can describe the summoned's movement and experession is with the words "half dead".

"I guess we're in that kind of simulation now…" the Summoned Muttered.

I wasn't exactly sure what to expect with this comment but it definitely didn't feel right.

What exactly is a simulation anyways?

I noticed summoned looking at the horn sticking out of the middle of my forehead and blinking emptily.

"If you're wondering about my horn, I'm an Ogre. I'm the single horn type."

"Oh… is that so."

"Um… Ok… So what type are you? I've never seen ears like yours before."

"Me? Just a human? I guess my technical species is 4ACF3567YH3G"

…

There wasn't a hint of sarcasm in the way the summoned delivered that line.

I'm not exaactly sure if the summoned is lying or joking or something else but I dont cant see the reason behind it if that's actually what it was. 

After all, the summoning ritual only summons people who are willing to be summoned so there shouldn't be any animosity so early on.

Ok, lets try something else then.

"What's your name? My name is Mikay as I mentioned earlier."

"Name…?" said the summoned with an unsure tone.

You can't be serious right?

The summoned didn't seem to know how to answer the question.

I mean how does a village function wtihout names?

As i was pondering this, the summoned spoke up again. 

"My universal Identification Code is A244X0Z4305PHAN4"

"A2… What? How?"

"It's A244X0Z4305PHAN4"

"A name like that doesn't seem practical at all." I said in bewilderment.

"Is it? It's been working out just fine for me so far. And besides I didn't say it was a name, I said it was my Universal Identification Code."

"Uni-what?"

"Universal Identification Code, It's a number that's used as an identification code and is mathematically guaranteed to be unique within the observable universe."

I staired blankly back…something's not right and I wasn't exactly sure what to feel.

And to top it off, that statement made way too little sense to me.

Still though, I was not quite sure what I was suppose call the summoned so I once again asked.

"So… what am I supposed to call you?"

"Probably just 4 then?" said 4 with an uninterested expression and still without sarcasm. 

"Uhh… What? Where did that come from?"

"It's the smallest number of my Universal Identitfication Code. I can call you Kay too since it's easier."

"Ok hold on a second here, I dont know what your deal is but you cant just go around and naming other people."

"But I'm not naming you. All I'm doing is using the most concise way of addressing you."

"Huh???"

I gave 4 a confused look and unsurprisingly, i got one back in return. 

"Look, I just need a reasonable thing to call you, is that just too much to ask?"

"4 seems pretty reasonable to me." 4 said again without a hint of sarcasm. 

I'm truely not sure how I felt about this.

The conversation I'm having with 4 is really just going nowhere and the tone in 4's voice sounded completely hollow as if there's no soul behind any of the words that were spoken.

Honestly, I can only describe this conversation as both passive and aggressive. Maybe that should be a new word or phrase or something. 

That said, there's definitely some kind of unwillingness to help behind 4's words and tone thus far. However, there shouldn't be any reason for the summoned to like this.

The summoning ritual is supposed to only calls forth those who are willing to cooperate so considering how uncooperative 4 has been thus far, I can only really call it a failure. 

Maybe this is why summoning rituals were exclusively performed in rooms instead of aquariums since an uncooperative summon is a pretty hefty price to pay.

In fact I was starting to feel unsure about if this whole summoning thing succeeded at all judging by what little conversation that me and the summoned had had. 

However, I didn't really have anything to lose by continueing this conversation. Honestly, at the very least, I should get a proper name out of 4 so I can at least have a name to use when thinking back on the current series of events in the future.

That was what happened to my previous summoning. Since his accent was so thick, I wasn't really able to understand half the stuff he said. In fact I couldn't even catch his name before he fell ill and once the illess set in, any hope of getting a name out of him was gone.

I started immagining a future scenario where I had to recount the events of right now and of my recent past and the prospect of having to use Unnamed Summon #1 and Unnamed Summon #2 

Ya, that's definitely not going to work out. Having 1 unnamed summon is one too many already.

That's why I decided to continue questioning the current summoned despite me pretty much already labeling this summoning a failure.

"What do people normally call you in your home world?"

"Mostly N4 or AN4 since it's too easy to get who's who mixed up when being addressed by just 1 number."

"Then why did you tell me you're 4 earlier?"

"4 is the smallest number in my Universal Identification Code that can be used to uniquely identify one of us when it's just the 2 of us in a conversation."

"Right, and you just add more characters to the name as the need arise? but why from the back?"

"Actually, my Universal Identification Code is a number, a base 36 number."

"A what?"

4 sighed and began speaking again and for the first time, there was an emotion acompanying the voice; the emotion of annoyance.

"What's the biggest single digit number?"

"9"

"Right, now for a second immage that 10 was a single digit number, let say using the letter A. If we do that 1A would functionally be 21 right?"

"What?"

I gave 4 a confused look and quickly looked down at my hand to run through the scenario on my palm. 

If the number A was the same as the numer 10 then the number 10 under this scenario would be the same as 11 right. That would mean 10 + A would make 1A which is the be the same as 11 + 10 and ya that would indeed make 21.

After confirming this, I looked back up.

"Well if you put it that way sure but I dont see where this is going." I said with skepticism.

"Right now immagine if you can represent any number up to 36 with a single digit by using this system. start from 0 to 9 and then from A to Z. You get it now?"

Struck with newfound understanding, I immediately looked down at my palm again trying to figure out what 4's code thing would translate to but I honestly can't even remember anything past AN4 now. 

As I thought this, 4 spoke up again

"Dont worry too much about what the number my Universal Identification Code actually is. All you have to know is that my Universal Identification Code is a number and that the smallest sub number that is unique within a group of people is generally what gets used for the purpose of addressing people"

After hearing this, I started feeling a bit bad for 4. 

I mean, a world where names are literally just numbers? What sort of hell world is this?

"Have you ever wanted a proper name?" I asked.

"Not really, some people from my world really liked that concept and even took up names but I don't really see the need for it. And besides, it just makes things more complicated. Just imagine if there was someone else here called Mikay"

"Well I can't keep calling you 4. I can't even remember your code thing past AN4."

"Then just remember PHAN4. That number uniquely identifies me in the district I once lived in."

"PHAN4… Do you mind if I give you a name. PHAN4 is just too much of a mouthful to say"

"Sure, do whatever, not like I'm going to be addressing myself anytime soon."

"Right, so how does Phanna sound to you as a name?"

"Sure, call me whatever you want" Phanna said with a shrug and in the emotionless flat tone.

I guess there's at least a useable name to call Phanna now.

But judging from the conversation just now, I had a feeling that the amount of resistance might just be a cultural barrier. 

I mean I still can't immagine what a world without names is like and how different it'd be too.

Maybe I shouldn't call Phanna a failure just yet.

After finally settling the matter of what to call Phanna, I really need to settle the next most important thing on my to do list.

At the very least I should give it a try.

"Phanna?"

"Hmm?"

"Would you be willing to help save my daughter?"
