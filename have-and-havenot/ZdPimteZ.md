# Reason

It's been about a week since I successfully summoned Phanna. 

Ethan, for some reason, has been living in my living room for the last week as well. 

In the beginning, I didn't really think much of it.

In fact, I was quite thankful that he was willing to stay with me to keep an eye on Phanna's condition.

But the more time we spend together, the more I start to realize just how annoying it is to have my self proclaimed number 1 fan around me at all times. 

Not only that, he also didn't really return to the school at all during the past week. 

The thought of him being neglectful of his duties drove me crazy but he assured me that everything is undercontrol and that his absence isn't being felt at all.

That said, he does seem to be very sincere.

That much is obvious. 

To be honest, I kind of feel bad for him and the school.

I had initially thought that he would just come over for a few hours after school every day.

But now that he's permanantly staying with me and Phanna, I felt partly responsiable for whatever condition the school somehow ends up in.

Honestly, I'm starting to feel like I should do more than just judge the entrence exam given how much Ethan has been doing for me and how much of his school affairs I've messed up pulling him away for so long. 

Though thanks to Ethan's hard work, Phanna is in relatively good shape at the moment.

I entered the room Phanna's was in and saw Phanna in bed under a couple sheets of blankets. 

Phanna might be stuck in bed with a heavy feaver right now but that's about it. 

I remember my previous Champion was caughing up blood by now. 

Pillow has returned to it's aquarium as well, but Phanna still somehow manages to gets a hold of it randomly. 

I'm honestly starting to feel bad for Pillow now. 

I looked over to the Aquarium not sure what to expect.

Pillow wasn't in there.

I looked back over to Phanna and sure enough, there was a large wiggling lump under the blanket.

"Phanna, You really do like Pillow don't you."

"Yah, so?"

"You gotta treat it with respect you know."

"I am."

"Look at how much it's squerming. It obviousely doens't want to be hugged that way."

"Why wouldn't it? And besides, all the wiggling is excitement."

"Do you seriously believe what you're saying?"

"N-no" said Phanna as they looked away from me with a pouty face.

"Phanna..."

"Fine..."

Almost immediate, the wiggling blob under Phanna's blanket made it's way out and into the corner of the room. 

Of course, I knew exactly what the blob was and didn't even give it a glance. 

"You need to be nicer to Pillow, then it'll let you hug it more." I scolded.

"Meh"

Phanna doesn't seem to take what i've said to heart.

I let out a sigh in responce. 

"Phanna, let me check your temperture." I said in an attempt to change the topic.

"I'm fine." Phanna proested. 

But I didn't care for Phanna's protests, after all, they've got no way of stopping me.

I activated my ability Observe and made an attempt at reading Phanna's body temperture. 

40° C

This temperture wasn't particularly high compaired to Phanna's normal tempreture according to Ethan. 

During the Ethan's inital checkup, he noted that Phanna's core tempreture at that time was 38° C. 

This was slighly higher than what my body does but is rather normal for Elves according to Ethan. 

Seeing this, made me feel a bit more a ease.

"Hear Phanna drink this." I said as I lifted the bottle I was holding on to.

"I dont want to drink more matcha. At least put some sugar and cream in." Phanna pouted

"It's karma plant, stop calling it matcha or whatever."

Despite Phanna's protest, they did eventually drink the bottle of powdered karma plant leaves.

"Bleh"

"See it wasn't so bad right."

Honestly seeing Phanna act this way reminds me of my days raising Hikery. 

She used to do the same thing except without the strange names for random things.

I took the bottle from Phanna and planed it on the table on the other side of the room before picking up Pillow on the ground next to me and placing it into the aquarium.

Pillow swam around in the aquarium once I placed it in the water.

"This pillow thing is quite intrsting, I would have never thought that an gigantic ameba would make such a nice pet."

Of course, I ignored Phanna's comment and returned to the bed that Phanna was laying on. 

"I signed you up for an entrence exam to Ethan's school."

"I refuse."

We've had this exact same conversation multiple times over the past week. 

It always came down to Phanna not wanting to do something called "Manual Knowledge Acquisition"

I remember Phanna explaining what it was and how it works but I didn't understand nor did I care to understand. 

There were a few other Something Something Knowledge Acquisition techniques that Phanna talked about but I didn't really care. 

However, this time, things would be different.

I had a new approach for convincing Phanna to join the entrence exams.

I had a huntch this might work so I decided to give it a try.

"Phanna, you don't have to study at Ethan's school after."

"I know. I can just purposely fail the exam and be done with it."

"Then why are you so against it?"

"...Because that's not what I'm here for."

"What are you hear for then?"

Phanna didn't respond for a few seconds.

I can tell Phanna's deep in thought.

But after a few seconds, Phanna finally spoke up again.

"I'm here to forget, to drown my sorrows away, to kill time maybe..."

I didn't respond.

I had a feeling Phanna had more to say.

A few more seconds passed.

"People only die when they are killed, that's what my home world is like. Of course, you already knew that right."

I gave Phanna a nod.

I didn't want to believe it and the concept seemed impossiable but I've already came to terms with this idea.

"How many people do you think would end up living in a world like this?"

I shruged

"It's really big number... You see, me and my two closes friends were nobodies in a world like that. for everything that made any of us unique, there was bound to be at least a couple thousand people with the exact same trate. in fact, the only way to be unique was by splitting hairs. for example, compairing fingerprints on 2 or more fingers and such since it's probable enough for some other indiviual to have the exact same fingerprint on exact same finger that single fingerprints aren't used for identification anymore. Do you know how it feels to be just another +1 to some tally somewhere that no one cares about or remembers."

"I'm sorry..." I found myself saying.

But Phanna ignored my sentiment.

It was only fair given how many times I've done the same.

"Me and my best friends wanted to be truly unique in some way, remembered for something but we failed. Two of my best friends ended up ending their own lives because of that and here I am, unable to do the same. That's why I'm here, to forget, to give up, to kill time, to... I don't know. But what I'm not here to do is to retread someone else's path"

Phanna looked away.

I felt bad for them. 

I kind of understand why they're always hugging Pillow now.

I breathed deeply.

I didn't know if Phanna was crying or not but if they were, I wouldn't be supprised.

I wanted to ask "What does that have to do with the exam" but I knew asking that was a mistake right now. 

"I'm sorry..." I found myself repeating again as I left the room.

Another try another failure, again. 

"You can always try again tomorrow." Ethan said as I entered the living room.

"I don't even understand why Phanna is so against partaking in the exam."

"Didn't Phanna say something about it not being their goal or something?"

"I know, but nothing Phanna says makes any sense to me." I sighed.

"Think on the bright side Master Mikay, today's conversation wasn't a complete repeat of yesterday's conversation." Ethan encouraged.

I nodded in agreement. 

Maybe I can think over what Phanna has told me today and figure out a way to convince them tomorrow.
 
Thinking back on the stuff Phanna said...

Honestly I didn't understand much of it.

The key points that I understood we're:

1. There was an insane amount of people who lived in Phanna's home word.
2. Phanna's desire to be unique in a world like that.
3. Phanna's failure and subsiquent loss of their friends.

Given how Phanna is acting, there's a high likelyhood that they're still mourning the loss of their friends.

Then agnin, absolute refusal to partake in the entrence exams sure doesn't seem like something a mourning person would do without good reason.

I know Phanna just explained the reason but I still honestly don't understand any of it.

Actually, I don't really understand Phanna's reasons for doing anything I feel.

Maybe if I can understand Phanna's reason for becoming a champion, I'd be able to better find a way to talk them into taking the exams.

With my next discussion with Phanna decided, all I need to do now is to prepair some food and wait till dinner time.

Speaking of dinner, every day, Phanna has been giving me strange ingrediant lists and even stranger cooking instructions.

Initially, I didn't take it very seriousely but a few days ago, I tried one of it and it ended up tasting a lot better than I thought with such strange methods. 

But despite the results, ingrediants were definately more dificult to get. 

Since we didn't live by the ocean, salt is some what hard to come by and so was meat other than birds or fish.

Despite that, I end up trying to cook according to Phanna's strange recipies while making sure to object to any unrealistic requests in hopes that Phanna will see my sincerity and maybe start seeing things from my perspective.

It's not like I didn't explain why I needed Phanna to attend the entrence exams.

"Hey Ethan, I'll be out getting some ingrediants that Phanna said they wanted for today's dinner" I sighed as I stood up from the chair.

Ethan gave me a firm nod in reponse and with that, I left to search for a way to realize whatever strange creation Phanna dreampt up today.

...

I once again returned to the room Phanna's resting in with a tray full of dinner in hand.

I looked to the aquarium as I always do when entering this room.

Pillow's not there.

I looked over to Phanna and sure enough, there's a lump under the blankets wiggling around.

Noticing where my gaze is pointing to, Phanna looked away and almost immediately, Pillow slipped out from under the blankets.

I let out a sigh and walked over to Phanna's bed.

"How long have you been hugging Pillow this time?"

"... Since you left the house"

"How would you feel if you were Pillow?" I said while gesturing for Phanna to sit up.

"I... I dont know. Besides, if Pillow's capable of feeling anything is debateable." Phanna protested while sitting up.

"Lets try something else, what are pets like in your home world like?" I asked as I created some legs on the underside of the try with my Forgemaster ability.

"They're mostly fluffy non-human quadrapedal animals with a tendency to die from random illnesses. Consiquently, they're not very popular. Most people only ever get one in their lifetime if any at all since the loss of a pet is quite a tramatic experiance for most people."

"I think that's just called growing old." I said half jokingly.

"Are you saying you're... Know what, forget it."

I had a pretty good idea that Phanna was compairing me to a pet.

Normally, I'd be rather offended by even just the notion that me and a pet is anything comparable.

But with Phanna, I feel like I've fully given up.

How Phanna's mind works is a complete mystery to me, a black box with inner workings completley unknowable to outside observers like me.

Spending effort trying to comprehend any of Phanna's nonsense was just going to end up hurting my head.

Yet here I am with the daunting task of trying to understand why Phanna chose to be summoned ahead of me.

The most I can do now is just to ease myself into this task and hope that I don't get too overwhelmed by Phanna's nonsense before I hit the key points.

And so, I continued.

"Have you ever had a pet?"

"No"

"You seem to be quite knowledgeable about pets despite never having had one before."

"One of my parents used to have one while I was growing up. I vaugely remember it being something fluffy and had 4 legs. I think it died when I was between 10 and 20 I think."

"Oh? How did you get along with this pet?"

"I don't rememeber. I archived those memories a few hundred years ago when I started working on the become unique plan. Should I search through the archives for memories of my pet?"

"No, it's fine." I replied as if I understood any of what was said.

I walked over to PIllow by the corner of the room and moved it back into the aquarium before getting a chair from the desk and sitting myself back down next to bed.

By now, Phanna looks like they're mostly finished with eating and looked like it was now a good time to get to the big question at hand. 

I took a deep breath and began.

"Phanna, why did you choose to get summoned?"

Phana, a little supprised by my question, turned to look at me with a concerned face before replying with:

"Why are you asking?"

"I..."

I didn't know how to answer. 

I paused unsure of how to answer. 

Maybe I can brush it off?

"Well, does the reason matter?"

"Not really. I was just curious."

"Oh I see." I said as I tried to hide my relief.

"I guess I told you already that I wanted to just kill time and forget."

"Forget about what... if I you don't mind me asking."

"Forget... about my friends..." 

Phanna then moved their gaze away from me and onto Pillow in the aquarium.

"Since I can theoritically live's forever, I need to forget chunks of memeory every now and then. There's just isn't enough space to store thousands of years of memory in my brain."

Phanna pointed to their head with their finger and then continued.

"On avarage, it takes about 500 years for one archiving cycle to take place and majority of the unused memories are extracted from my head and put into my bones. However, some extremely strong memories stay with me even after an archiving event such as the memories of my pet. Though much of it is gone now, I still have vague memeories of it."

I nodded in sympathy. 

Although I don't fully understand what Phanna's saying, I feel like at least I'm understanding the general idea of it.
