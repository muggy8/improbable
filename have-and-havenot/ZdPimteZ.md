# Fact and Fiction

It's been about a week since I successfully summoned Phanna. 

Ethan, for some reason, has been living in my living room for the last week as well. 

In the beginning, I didn't really think much of it.

In fact, I was quite thankful that he was willing to stay with me to keep an eye on Phanna's condition.

But the more time we spend together, the more I start to realize just how annoying it is to have my self proclaimed number 1 fan around me at all times. 

Not only that, he also didn't really return to the school at all during the past week. 

The thought of him being neglectful of his duties drove me crazy but he assured me that everything is undercontrol and that his absence isn't being felt at all.

That said, he does seem to be very sincere.

That much is obvious. 

To be honest, I kind of feel bad for him and the school.

I had initially thought that he would just stay around for a hours a day after school ends but now that he's permanantly staying with me and Phanna, I felt partly responsiable for whatever condition the school somehow ends up in.

Honestly, I'm starting to feel like I should do more than just judge the entrence exam given how much Ethan has been doing for me and how much of his school affairs I've messed up pulling him away for so long.
