# Reason

It’s been about a week since I successfully summoned Phanna.

Ethan, for some reason, has been living in my living room for the last week as well.

In the beginning, I didn’t think much of it.

On the contrary, I was quite thankful that he was willing to stay with me to keep an eye on Phanna’s condition.

But the more time we spend together, the more I’ve come to realize just how annoying it is to have my self-proclaimed number 1 fan around me at all times.

Not only that but also he didn’t return to the school at all during the past week.

The thought of him being neglectful of his duties drove me crazy. All the more so because the cause of it was me.

But he assured me that everything is under control and that his absence isn’t being felt at all.

That said, he does seem to be very sincere, that much is obvious.

To be honest, I kind of felt bad for him and the school.

I had initially thought that he would just come over for a few hours after school every day.

But now that he’s permanently staying with me and Phanna, I felt responsible for whatever condition the school ends up in because of Ethan’s absence.

Honestly, I’m starting to feel like I should do more than just judge the entrance exam given how much Ethan has been doing for me 

and how much of his school affairs I’ve messed up by pulling him away for so long.

Though thanks to Ethan’s hard work, Phanna is in relatively good shape at the moment.

I entered the room where Phanna was residing in.

There I saw Phanna in bed under a couple of sheets under the blankets.

Phanna might be stuck in bed with a heavy fever right now but that’s about it.

It made me remember how my previous Champion wa coughing up blood by this point.

Pillow has returned to its aquarium as well, but Phanna still somehow manages to get a hold of it randomly.

Honestly, I'm starting to feel bad for Pillow now.

I looked over to the Aquarium not sure what to expect but Pillow wasn’t there in it.

I looked back over to Phanna and sure enough, there was a large wiggling lump under the blanket.

“Phanna, You really do like Pillow, don’t you?”

“Yeah, so?”

“You gotta treat it with respect you know.”

“I am.”

“Look at how much it’s squirming. It obviously doesn’t want to be hugged that way.”

“Why wouldn’t it? And besides, all the wiggling is excitement.”

“Do you seriously believe what you’re saying?”

“N-no,” said Phanna while looking away from me with a pouty face.

“Phanna…”

“Fine…”

Almost immediately, the wiggling blob under Phanna’s blanket made its way out into the corner of the room.

Of course, I knew exactly what the blob was and didn’t even glance at it.

“You need to be nicer to Pillow, then it’ll let you hug it more.” I scolded.

“Meh”

Phanna doesn’t seem to take what I’ve said to heart.

I let out a sigh in response.

“Phanna, let me check your temperature,” I said in an attempt to change the topic.

“I’m fine.” Phanna protested.

But I didn’t care for Phanna’s protests, after all, they’ve got no way of stopping me.

I activated my ability Observe and made an attempt at reading Phanna’s body temperature.

40° C

According to Ethan, this temperature wasn’t particularly high compared to Phanna’s normal temperature.

During Ethan’s initial checkup, he noted that Phanna’s core temperature at that time was 38° C.

This was slightly higher than what my body does but it is rather normal for Elves according to Ethan.

Seeing this, made me feel a bit more at ease.

“Here, Phanna, drink this,” I said as I lifted the bottle I was holding.

“I don’t want to drink more matcha? At least put some sugar and cream in it.” Phanna pouted.

“It’s karma plant, stop calling it matcha or whatever.”

Despite Phanna’s protest, they did eventually drink the bottle of powdered leaves of the karma plant.

“Bleh”

“See it wasn’t so bad right.”

Honestly seeing Phanna act this way reminds me of my days raising Hickory.

She used to do the same thing except without the strange names for most of the things.

I took the bottle from Phanna and placed it on the table located on the other side of the room. But before that, I picked Pillow up off the ground and placed it back into the aquarium.

Pillow began swimming around in the aquarium once I placed it in the water.

“This pillow thing is quite interesting, I would have never thought that a gigantic ameba would make such a nice pet.”

Of course, I ignored Phanna’s comment and returned to the bed on which Phanna was resting on.

“I signed you up for an entrance exam in Ethan’s school.”

“I refuse.”

We’ve had this exact same conversation multiple times over the past week.

It always came down to Phanna not wanting to do something called “Manual Knowledge Acquisition”.

I remember Phanna explaining what it was and how it works but I didn’t understand nor did I care to understand.

There were a few other Something-Something Knowledge Acquisition techniques that Phanna talked about but I didn’t really care.

However, this time, things would be different.

I had a new approach toward trying to convince Phanna to join the entrance exam.

I had a hunch this might work so I decided to give it a try.

“Phanna, you don’t have to study at Ethan’s school after that.”

“I know. I can just purposely fail the exam and be done with it.”

“Then why are you so against it?”

“…Because that’s not what I’m here for.”

“What are you here for then?”

Phanna didn’t respond for a few seconds.

I can tell Phanna’s deep in thought.

But after a few seconds, Phanna finally spoke up again.

“I’m here to forget, to drown my sorrows away, to kill time maybe…”

I didn’t respond.

I had a feeling Phanna had more to say.

A few more seconds passed.

“People only die when they are killed, that’s what my homeworld is like. Of course, you already knew that, right.”

I gave Phanna a nod.

I didn’t want to believe it and the concept seemed impossible but I’ve already come to terms with this idea.

“How many people do you think would end up living in a world like this?”

I shrugged

“It’s a really big number… You see, my two closest friends and I were nobodies in a world like that. For any trait or combination of traits that made any of us unique, there was bound to be a mountain of people with the exact same trait or set of traits. In fact, the only way to be unique was by splitting hairs. For example, by comparing fingerprints on 2 or more fingers and other such pointless comparisons. Do you know how it feels to be just another +1 to some tally somewhere that no one cares about or remembers?”

“I’m sorry…” I found myself saying.

But Phanna ignored my sentiment.

It was only fair given how many times I’ve done the same.

“My best friends and I wanted to be truly unique in some way; being remembered for something; but we failed. Two of my best friends ended up ending their own lives because of that and here I am, unable to do the same. That’s why I’m here, to forget, to give up, to kill time, to… I don’t know…”

Phanna looked away.

I felt bad for Phanna.

I kind of understand why they’re always hugging Pillow now.

I took a deep breath.

I didn’t know if Phanna was crying or not but if they were, I wouldn’t be surprised.

I wanted to ask “What does that have to do with the exam” but I knew that asking that was a mistake right now.

“I’m sorry…” I found myself repeating as I left the room.

Another try resulted in another failure, once again.

“You can always try again tomorrow,” Ethan said as I entered the living room.

“I don’t even understand why Phanna is so against partaking in the exam.”

“Didn’t Phanna say something about it not being their goal or something?”

“I know, but nothing Phanna says makes any sense to me.” I sighed.

“Think on the bright side Master Mikay, today’s conversation wasn’t a complete repeat of yesterday’s conversation.” Ethan encouraged.

I nodded in agreement.

Maybe I can think over what Phanna has told me today and figure out a way to convince them tomorrow.

Thinking over the stuff Phanna said…

Honestly, I didn’t understand much of it.

The key points that I understood we’re:

1. There was an insane amount of people who lived in Phanna’s home-world.
2. Phanna’s desire to be unique in a world like that.
3. Phanna’s failure and subsequent loss of their friends.

Given how Phanna is acting, there’s a high likelihood that they’re still mourning the loss of their friends.

Then again, absolute refusal to partake in the entrance exams sure doesn’t seem like something a mourning person would do without good reason.

I know Phanna just explained the reason but I still honestly don’t understand any of it.

Actually, I felt like I didn’t understand Phanna’s reasons for doing anything.

Maybe, if I can understand Phanna’s reason for becoming a champion, I’d be able to better find a way to talk them into taking the exams.

However, that wasn’t going to be easy.

I recalled the first time I spoke with Phanna, what a horrifying experience it was!

But right now, I felt like I had no other choice but to make attempts to understand Phanna.

Like that, my next discussion with Phanna was decided, all I need to do now was to prepare some food and wait till dinner time.

Speaking of dinner, every day, Phanna has been giving me strange ingredient lists and even stranger cooking instructions.

Initially, I didn’t take it very seriously but a few days ago, I tried one of these strange recipes and it ended up tasting a lot better than I thought.

But despite the results, the ingredients Phanna requested were more difficult to get.

Since we didn’t live by the ocean, salt is somewhat hard to come by and so was meat other than birds or fish.

Despite that, I ended up mostly cooking according to Phanna’s strange recipes while making sure to object to any unrealistic request in hopes that Phanna will see my sincerity and maybe start seeing things from my perspective.

It’s not like I didn’t explain why I needed Phanna to attend the entrance exams.

“Hey Ethan, I’ll be out getting some ingredients that Phanna said they wanted for today’s dinner,” I sighed as I stood up from the chair.

Ethan gave me a firm nod in response, so I left to search for a way to realize whatever strange creation Phanna dreamt up today.

…

I once again returned to the room Phanna’s resting in with a tray full of dinner in hand.

I looked at the aquarium when I entered this room.

Pillow’s not there.

I looked over to Phanna and sure enough, there’s a lump under the blankets wiggling around.

Noticing where my gaze is pointing to, Phanna looked away, and almost immediately, Pillow slipped out beneath the blankets.

I let out a sigh and walked over to Phanna’s bed.

“How long have you been hugging Pillow this time?”

“… Since you left the house”

“How would you feel if you were Pillow?” I said while gesturing for Phanna to sit up.

“I… I don’t know. Besides, whether or not Pillow’s capable of feeling anything is debatable.” Phanna protested while sitting up.

“Let’s try something else then, what are pets like in your homeworld?” I asked as I molded some legs on the underside of the tray using my Forgemaster ability before placing the tray on the bed in front of Phanna.

“They’re mostly fluffy non-human quadrupedal animals with a tendency to die from random illnesses. Consequently, they’re not very popular. Most people only ever get one in their lifetime if any at all since the loss of a pet is quite a traumatic experience for most people.”

“I think that’s just called growing old,” I said half-jokingly.

“Are you saying you’re… Know what, forget it.”

I had a pretty good idea that Phanna was comparing me to a pet.

Normally, I’d be rather offended by even just the notion that a pet and I are comparable at all.

But with Phanna, I feel like I’ve fully given up.

How Phanna’s mind works is a complete mystery to me, a black box with inner workings completely unknowable to outside observers like me.

Spending effort trying to comprehend any of Phanna’s nonsense was just going to end up hurting my head.

Yet here I am with the daunting task ahead: trying to understand why Phanna chose to be summoned.

The most I can do now is just to ease myself into this task and hope that I don’t get too overwhelmed by Phanna’s nonsense before I hit the key points.

And so, I continued.

“Have you ever had a pet?”

“No”

“You seem to be quite knowledgeable about pets despite never having had one before.”

“One of my parents used to have one while I was growing up. I vaguely remember it being something fluffy and had 4 legs. I think it died when I was between 10 and 20 I think.”

“Oh? How did you get along with this pet?”

“I don’t remember. I archived those memories a few hundred years ago when I started trying to become unique. Should I search through my archives for memories of my pet?”

“No, it’s fine,” I replied as if I understood any of what was said.

I walked over to PIllow by the corner of the room and moved it back into the aquarium before getting a chair from the desk and sitting back down next to the bed.

By now, Phanna looks like they’re mostly finished with eating and looked like it was now a good time to get to the big question at hand.

I took a deep breath and began.

“Phanna, why did you choose to get summoned?”

Phanna, a little surprised by my question, turned to look at me with a concerned face before replying with:

“Why are you asking?”

“I…”

I didn’t know how to answer.

I paused unsure of how to answer.

Maybe I can brush it off?

“Well, does the reason matter?”

“Not really. I was just curious.”

“Oh I see,” I said as I tried to hide my relief.

“I guess I told you already that I wanted to just kill time and forget.”

“Forget about what… if you don’t mind me asking.”

“Forget… about my friends…”

Phanna then moved their gaze away from me and onto Pillow in the aquarium.

“Since I can theoretically live forever, I need to forget chunks of memory every now and then. There just isn’t enough space to store thousands of years of memory in my brain.”

Phanna pointed to their head with their finger and then continued.

“On average, it takes about 500 years for one archiving cycle to complete. Each archiving cycle extracts majority of the unused memories from my brain and puts them into my bones. However, some extremely strong memories stay with me even after a few archiving cycles such as the memories of the pet. Though much of it is gone now, I still have vague memories of it.”

I nodded in sympathy.

Although I don’t fully understand what Phanna’s saying, I feel like at least I’m understanding the general idea of it.

“Honestly, if I can just forget things on demand, things would be much easier, but, because of ethical and legal reasons, I have to wait for memories to fade away over time and get archived in order to forget. Unfortunately, traumatic memories don’t just go away that easily…”

“I… I see”

I feel like, for the first time, I am understanding Phanna.

Although much of it is still fuzzy, there are still some key details that I am able to get.

I guess trauma hurts for everyone, even for someone like Phanna who comes from a world extremely different from my own.

“Does that mean you intend to return to your homeworld eventually?” I asked.

“Eventually…” Phanna replied.

“So what do you plan on doing until then?”

“Nothing…”

“So you plan on just doing nothing for the next 500 years?”

“200”

“What?”

Phanna’s answer caught me by surprise.

“Didn’t you say it takes you 500 years to forget?”

“I said on average, 500 years is how long it takes for most memories to be archived. However, that doesn’t mean it’s true for all memories. I still have memories of the pet from my earliest days and I’m well over 800 at this point. From the looks of it, spending another 1000 years here might not even help me forget…”

“So why are you saying you only plan to stay for 200 years then?”

“Because in 200 years, I’d be old enough to apply for death.”

There Phanna goes again with the crazy and absurd claims.

I wanted to end our conversation right now before things start getting more senseless but I got into this whole mess with a mission and I’m going to see it through the end.

If I can just find something in all this nonsense that can help me convince Phanna to take the exam then that’s all I need.

And so, I pressed on.

“Phanna, are you telling me that you plan on dying in 200 years?”

“Yes.”

“Why?”

“Because I’ve given up.”

“On?”

“Everything.”

“…”

Phanna’s answers hurt as if they were cutting into me.

It brought up memories of the days immediately following the passing of Aurora, my late wife, and the departure of Hickory.

During those days, I felt like I’ve lost all hope and all I can do is to just accept whatever comes my way in the future.

But something changed after I was introduced to the Champion Summoning Ritual.

I had something I could do to change the future.

I felt like I was seeing myself in Phanna.

And then it struck me, Phanna right now is the same way I was after Aurora and Hickory departed from my life.

I felt like I was understanding Phanna a little more now.

It wasn’t much, but it was enough at present.

For the first time, I had a good idea of what was happening and what I wanted to say.

“Would you still choose death if you were able to forget?”

Phanna turned to look at me in surprise.

Was it because I said something that Phanna didn’t consider?

Was it because I said something out of character?

Was it because I said something that Phanna didn’t expect?

That’s something I’ll probably never know.

But I was in control now.

“Phanna, you see, I have a pretty good idea of how you feel right now. I used to feel the same way as you do, that nothing matters anymore, that all is hopeless.”

Phanna broke eye contact and looked down.

“Remember how I said my daughter betrayed the Mastery League?”

“Yeah?”

“Well, that wasn’t the only thing that happened. My wife, Aurora, also died that day.”

“I… I see…”

“The three of us as well as many others were on a joint mission to destroy a village under the control of a Phantom Lord. Hickory was the Grandmaster on the mission and was supposed to engage the opposing Phantom Lord. In the meantime, a group of Masters was to use that opportunity to attack the village and remove it as a future threat to the stability of our world. Both me and Aurora were pulled out of our teaching duties for this. It was supposed to be a swift and decisive victory. But it all went wrong when a second Phantom Lord showed up, Hickory betrayed the league and our attack failed horribly. Many died that day including my wife Aurora…”

My throat felt tense as I spoke those words.

I could remember those memories as if they happened just yesterday.

“Phanna, I want to ask you again, would you still choose death if you were able to forget?”

Phanna didn’t answer.

I didn’t expect an answer.

I was there once before and I knew that no amount of logic would be able to win someone in this state over.

But despite that, I also knew that this silence meant that I had been successful.

After all, answering “no” is to accept defeat, while answering “yes” signifies a complete lack of sympathy.

That's why I continued as if I got the response I wanted to hear.

“Phanna, is there a way to make forgetting faster for you?”

Phanna answered with a weak nod.

“Can you tell me how?”

“… new memories… a large number of new memories that are worth remembering.”

“How about this, I’ll help you in any way I can to create memories worth remembering while you help me with saving my daughter. Think you can manage a deal like this?”

Phanna nodded weakly again.

“Then can I get you to attend the entrance exams in Ethan’s school? It’s an interesting experience so I’m sure it’ll be worth remembering. I still remember doing the exams for the first time myself, not to Ethan’s school of course. That’s why I’m sure you’ll find it worthwhile. Is that alright?”

Again, Phanna replied with a weak nod.

I had won, but it didn’t feel like a victory.

For I know, the road ahead will be even harder than it was before.

And I also know I can no longer give up anymore.

But quitting was never part of the plan anyway.
