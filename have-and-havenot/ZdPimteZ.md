# Fact and Fiction

It's been about a week since I successfully summoned Phanna. 

Ethan, for some reason, has been living in my living room for the last week as well. 

In the beginning, I didn't really think much of it.

In fact, I was quite thankful that he was willing to stay with me to keep an eye on Phanna's condition.

But the more time we spend together, the more I start to realize just how annoying it is to have my self proclaimed number 1 fan around me at all times. 

Not only that, he also didn't really return to the school at all during the past week. 

The thought of him being neglectful of his duties drove me crazy but he assured me that everything is undercontrol and that his absence isn't being felt at all.

That said, he does seem to be very sincere.

That much is obvious. 

To be honest, I kind of feel bad for him and the school.

I had initially thought that he would just come over for a few hours after school every day.

But now that he's permanantly staying with me and Phanna, I felt partly responsiable for whatever condition the school somehow ends up in.

Honestly, I'm starting to feel like I should do more than just judge the entrence exam given how much Ethan has been doing for me and how much of his school affairs I've messed up pulling him away for so long. 

Though thanks to Ethan's hard work, Phanna is in relatively good shape at the moment.

I entered the room Phanna's was in and saw Phanna in bed under a couple sheets of blankets. 

Phanna might be stuck in bed with a heavy feaver right now but that's about it. 

I remember my previous Champion was caughing up blood by now. 

Pillow has returned to it's aquarium as well, but Phanna still somehow manages to gets a hold of it randomly. 

I'm honestly starting to feel bad for Pillow now. 

I looked over to the Aquarium not sure what to expect.

Pillow wasn't in there.

I looked back over to Phanna and sure enough, there was a large wiggling lump under the blanket.

"Phanna, You really do like Pillow don't you."

"Yah, so?"

"You gotta treat it with respect you know."

"I am."

"Look at how much it's squerming. It obviousely doens't want to be hugged that way."

"Why wouldn't it? And besides, all the wiggling is excitement."

"Do you seriously believe what you're saying?"

"N-no" said Phanna as they looked away from me with a pouty face.

"Phanna..."

"Fine..."

Almost immediate, the wiggling blob under Phanna's blanket made it's way out and into the corner of the room. 

Of course, I knew exactly what the blob was and didn't even give it a glance. 

"You need to be nicer to Pillow, then it'll let you hug it more." I scolded.

"Meh"

Phanna doesn't seem to take what i've said to heart.

I let out a sigh in responce. 

"Phanna, let me check your temperture." I said in an attempt to change the topic.

"I'm fine." Phanna proested. 

But I didn't care for Phanna's protests, after all, they've got no way of stopping me.

I activated my ability Observe and made an attempt at reading Phanna's body temperture. 

40° C

This temperture wasn't particularly high compaired to Phanna's normal tempreture according to Ethan. 

During the Ethan's inital checkup, he noted that Phanna's core tempreture at that time was 38° C. 

This was slighly higher than what my body does but is rather normal for Elves according to Ethan. 

Seeing this, made me feel a bit more a ease.

"Hear Phanna drink this." I said as I lifted the bottle I was holding on to.

"I dont want to drink more matcha. At least put some sugar and cream in." Phanna pouted

"It's karma plant, stop calling it matcha or whatever."

Despite Phanna's protest, they did eventually drink the bottle of powdered karma plant leaves.

"Bleh"

"See it wasn't so bad right."

Honestly seeing Phanna act this way reminds me of my days raising Hikery. 

She used to do the same thing except without the strange names for random things.

I took the bottle from Phanna and planed it on the table on the other side of the room before picking up Pillow on the ground next to me and placing it into the aquarium.

Pillow swam around in the aquarium once I placed it in the water.

"This pillow thing is quite intrsting, I would have never thought that an gigantic ameba would make such a nice pet."

Of course, I ignored Phanna's comment and returned to the bed that Phanna was laying on. 

"I signed you up for an entrence exam to Ethan's school."

"I refuse."

We've had this exact same conversation multiple times over the past week. 

It always came down to Phanna not wanting to do something called "Manual Knowledge Acquisition"

I remember Phanna explaining what it was and how it works but I didn't understand nor did I care to understand. 

There were a few other Something Something Knowledge Acquisition techniques that Phanna talked about but I didn't really care. 

However, this time, things would be different.

I had a new approach for convincing Phanna to join the entrence exams.

I had a huntch this might work so I decided to give it a try.

"Phanna, you don't have to study at Ethan's school after."

"I know. I can just purposely fail the exam and be done with it."

"Then why are you so against it?"

"...Because that's not what I'm here for."

"What are you hear for then?"

Phanna didn't respond for a few seconds.

I can tell Phanna's deep in thought.

But after a few seconds, Phanna finally spoke up again.

"I'm here to forget, to drown my sorrows away, to kill time maybe..."

I didn't respond.

I had a feeling Phanna had more to say.

A few more seconds passed.

"People only die when they are killed, that's what my home world is like. Of course, you already knew that right."

I gave Phanna a nod.

I didn't want to believe it and the concept seemed impossiable but I've already came to terms with this idea.

"How many people do you think would end up living in a world like this?"

I shruged

"It's really big number... You see, me and my two closes friends were nobodies in a world like that. for everything that made any of us unique, there was bound to be at least a couple thousand people with the exact same trate. in fact, the only way to be unique was by splitting hairs. for example, compairing fingerprints on 2 or more fingers and such since it's probable enough for some other indiviual to have the exact same fingerprint on exact same finger that single fingerprints aren't used for identification anymore. Do you know how it feels to be just another +1 to some tally somewhere that no one cares about or remembers."

"I'm sorry..." I found myself saying.

But Phanna ignored my sentiment.

It was only fair given how many times I've done the same.

"Me and my best friends wanted to be truly unique in some way, remembered for something but we failed. two of them ended up ending their own lives and here I am, unable to do the same. that's why I'm here, to forget, to give up, to kill time, to... I don't know."

Phanna looked away.

I felt bad for them. 

I kind of understand why they're always hugging Pillow now.

I breathed deeply.

I didn't know if Phanna was crying or not but if they were, I wouldn't be supprised.

"I'm sorry..." I found myself repeating and left the room again.
