# Proper Form

"Begin when ready" Ethan called in the exact same way he had the two previous rounds.

My eyes were focused on Melody and her oppenent. 

She did strike up a conversation with me so in a way, I was rooting for her.

She was extremely nervious when she left but I'm sure she'll be fine.

Her opponent seemed like a male variant of his species. 

He had horns on his head like the one Mikay has poking out of his forehead except this person had 2 of them.

I guess the fashion sense of this world is quite different.

Melody didn't immediately get into a combat stance but instead chatted away with the horned boy.

Unfortunately, they were too far away to hear. 

I honestly was quite curious at what her chatter was since I was rooting for her for she was the only person I had any interaction with here.

The conversation didn't last too long as Melody and the horned boy both got into some sort of fighting stance.

Melody was the first to strike. 

Compaired to her sister, Melody felt slow and slugish.

She charged at the horned boy and swung her fist at him.

He blocked her punch with ease but that wasn't the end.

Using the momentum of her run, Melody tackled the horned boy with her body.

But the horned boy was only pushed back slightly. 

Melody swung her arm around the horned boy's and seemed to be making her best attempt at pushing him but she doesn't seem to be making any progress.

As this happened, hhe horned boy made his move by kicking into her body as his hands were caught Melody's hold.

Melody took a hit, then another...

The third hit came and she flew off of the boy.

She didn't look like she was in good shape but she continued anyways.

She made the same approach as last time and the boy blocked her attack all the same.

She tackled him right after in the same way too but this time making much more progress.

Unfortunately, the one of the horned boy's arms were free this time and he pummled her with with his free arm and also kicked at her.

This time, things seemed different.

Melody made an attmept to push the horned boy to the side during his kick.

This seemed to have succeeded as the boy fell to his side.

During his fall, he grabbed Melody with his free hand and pulled her down too.

As the horned boy hit the floor back first, he also swung up a powerful kick and launched Melody off the platform.

I was dumbfounded.

Why did she make the exact same apprach as the first time.

The horned boy get up.

He then got off of the stage, helped Melody up off the floor and returned to the benches.

Melody did the same and sat down next to me again. 

She was quiet.

Melody's sister was the first to speak up.

"How's your body holding up?"

"I... I don't know..."

"You should have had strengthen active from the start."

"..."

"Did he kick you here?" Melody's sister asked while looking at where melody's hands were.

Melody noded in responce.

I didn't notice earlier but Melody had her hand on her stomach region the entire time.

Did Melody sustain some major damage?

"Should I let Ethan know you're hurt?" I asked.

But Melody shaked her head.

"No, it's fine."

"Are you sure? He's some sort of medical specialist or something. If you're hurt, you should at least get some first aid."

"You seem to be speaking in riddles Phanna. Anyways, just leave Melody to my care." 

Melody's sister cut me off and then began inspecting Melody. 

I wasn't exactly sure what she was doing but I left Melody and her sister to their own devices as I looked up to watch the other contestants.

There was only one single pair of fighters still fighting at this point. 

judging by the looks of it, they faught each other in much the same way that Melody and the horned boy were.

Sumo Boxing felt like an appropriate description. 

Eventually, the last fight ended with one contestant getting pushed off the platform.

Ethan made his round call again shortly after.

"Good work to our round 3 contestants, now, would shapes square, trapazoid, triangle and pentagon please come up."

I checked my card at Ethan's call.

A green dot.

I guess my shape is circle.

I then looked to check on Melody and her sister.

They, too, didn't move after checking their cards. 

I felt a sense of relief for Melody as she's currently being treated by her sister. 

I looked on as 8 other prospective students took to the field.

Strangely enough, I seemed to know two of them; Adrian, my opponent last round, and Leon, who's name I over heard from Melody's sister's round.

Leon and Adrian ended up on the same platform facing off against each other.

The other contestants, I didn't recognize. 

"Begin when ready" Shouted Ethan as usual.

This time, two of the 4 pairs of fighters engaged each other.

Leon and Adrian didn't, instead, they chatted.

I couldn't say I wasn't curious about their fight since I pretty much knew how the other fights will play out.

The others will likely be doing the sumo boxing thing that Melody did last round until someone gets ejected from the platform.

However, during Leon's fight with Melody's sister, it was clear that he was a cut above the others.

I watched Leon and Adrian closely but their chater didn't seem to ever end.

I looked around me and noticed that everyone was looking at Adrian and Leon as well.

Feeling a bit curious and sort of comfortable with Melody, I leaned in to her and asked:

"Why is everyone watching Leon and Adrian?"

"You don't know? Well I think it makes sense you don't since you didn't do the pre-exam trials. For those of us who did, we know that those two placed first and second in those pre-exam trials you didn't do."

"Intresting... thanks." I replied as I looked back to the stage to where Adrian and Leon were still chatting.

It wasn't until the first pair of fighters left the stage before Leon and Adrian jumped at each other.

Unlike his fight with me, Adrian took the initiative and charged at Leon.

Not to be out done, Leon also charged at Adrian.

As the two approched each other, Adrian dropped himself into a sliding tackle which kind of reminds me of people playing soccer.

Leon completely avoided the attack and jumped up into the air.

Adrian immediately sat up from his slide tackle making an attmept to grab Leon's legs but Leon managed to avoid the grab.

Leon's momentum carried him behide Adrian and he swiftly turned around with a low sweep. 

Adrian got slamed hard by Leon's low sweep and rolled over a bit before getting up and charging at Leon again.

Leon, unfazed by Adrian's charge, got down low to meet Adrian's charge head on.

Adrian collided into Leon with a punch but Leon didn't budge much.

Instead, Leon grabbed Adrian with both hands and tossed Adrian out of the platform. 

This was probably the shortest fight yet. 

feeling a bit curious, I turned to ask Melody anothes question.

"Why does it seem like the attacker is always at a disadvantage?"

"What do you mean?"

"Well, I've just been looking but it seems that in the vast majority of fights, the one doing the attacking loses more often."

"Really? I didn't notice that." Melody said in surprise.

I noticed Melody's sister pondering my question as well.

I shifted my gaze to Melody's sister and she answered my gaze with her own.

"I think it's because this is a strictly no killing allowed match. Most of the time, the person to attack first has a significant advantage but because lethal force is explicitly forbidden, first stike advantage is not as impactful. Infact, it might become a hinderance."

This explanation seemed rather reasonable to me as I shifted my gaze back to the platforms.

Shortly after, the next round began.

"Good work to our round 4 contestanats, now, would shapes heart, circle, octogon and star please come up."

I got up off the bench and made my why to Ethan.

As I got up, I noticed that Melody's sister got up too.

I tried my best to be the last one in line but she was careful to position herself behind me.

By the time I was talking to Ethan, I already knew who I was facing since 3 of the 4 platforms were already full.

"Phanna, please actually fight properly this time." Ethan plead.

I honestly didn't want to and I think my facial expression showed it as Ethan immediately followed up his comment.

"Think of it this way Phanna, you'd be fighting against a completely new way of fighting."

"Fine fine" I sighed. 

"That's a promise right?"

"I promise to fight a real fight." I lemented.

"Perfect! your platform is that one." Ethan said pointing to the only empty platform.

I departed Ethan and walked towards the empty platform muttering:

"user load_experaince grandiose's combat"

As the experiance pack loaded, I could feel a change in my posture as I got up onto the stage.

Shortly after, Melody's sister got onto the platfom facing me.

"Begin when ready." called Ethan.

"Hello Phanna, lets have a proper fight as you promised. Allow me to formally introduce myself, I am Amanda of the northern mountains elves."

Quite the formal introduction from Melody's sister. I think I'll do the same.

"Um. Hi? I'm user A244X0Z4305PHAN4 of Black Hole 9M6GB4A5's 87th shell."

Amanda gave me a confused look as she readied herself.

From the looks of it, she didn't intend to attack first if at all, probably because of my earlier observation.

Feeling a bit stupid, I attempted to bait her into attacking first.

"So um... Ladies first?"

"No no, even though you appear to be a half elf, it's rare to see a male elf of any kind outside of the colony, I'd rather give you the freedom to strike frist in whatever way you like." she answered with a smile.

No surprises there.

I engaged my hip-to-foot tendon as I got ready to initiate the attack. 

I could have tried to talk her into attacking first more but I knew that that'd be a waist of time.

Even if I got her to attack first, my goal has always been to end this as soon as I can win or lose.

So I guess taking the attack role doesn't really matter in the grand scheme of things. 

I took multiple deep breaths then got into position.

As soon as I was in position, I jumped towards Amanda.

I would be abe to close the gap in a single leap.

Amanada didn't try to avoid the attack.

I was hoping she did.

My leap would have landed me off of the platform.

I swung my leg at Amanda's head as I drew close.

She didn't flintch at my approach.

My shin landed strait onto her head.

Amanda barely budged.

My body twisted unexpectidly as my kick landed as if to avoid something.

Just then, a fist came flying up through where my body just was.

It was amanda's fist.

I wasn't sure how I reacted to that but I was glad I did.

I then noticed that somehow had my other leg fully spring loaded.

Before I even had the chance to realize, my leg kicked amanda sending me away from her.

Amanda's body barely reacted to the kick.

As I retreated, I notice Amanda's other arm grabing at where I once wasd

I landed a short ways away and immediately bounced right back towards Amanda.

She kept her eyes on me during this whole manuver.

I threw a punch at her as I approached.

She didn't react much or maybe couldn't.

My fist landed right into her gut.

But she didn't budge much while absorbing my entire strike.

Immediately after, I kicked the ground and back fliped over Amanda. 

Upon landing, I used the momentum of my jump to swing around for a low sweep.

My sweep caught Amanda as she turned around.

She fell to the ground.

Still spinning with the momentum, I grabbed Amanda as she fell and made an attempt to throw her in the direction of my spin.

But she planted her feet into the ground in time to only get flipped over.

Amanda was about to land face first into the ground but she caught her fall with her arms.

I took this oppertunity to kick at her full force.

Instead of getting kicked off the stage, Amanda caught my kick with her body.

She curled up around my leg and had a firm grip on me.

I desprately tried to sake her off with no success.

Soon enough, she got a hold of my other leg too.

After that point, she was able to push me to the ground too.

I tried my best to get free but her grip on my legs were iron tight. 

Shortly after, she got up off the ground still with a firm grip on both my legs.

"I'll admit, you're skill is impecable. But fighting without using any abilities puts you at a great handicap." Amanda said to me as I lay face first on the ground with both my feets firmly in her grip.

"I'm not quite sure if what you're calling abilities is what I have in mind."

"Tell me, who are you really?"

"I'm user A244X0Z4305PHAN4 or as Mikay would say, Phanna."

Amanda didn't like my answer.

"Well if you can't tell me who you are at least tell me what you are."

"I'm just an avarage human."

"With these feet?" Amanda pressed.

"What about my feet?"

"They look nothing like anything I've seen, not only that, your ears are absolutely abnormal what are you really."

"Like I said already, I'm just a human. I can pass the Turing Test with ease so I'm a human. Nothing more nothing less."

I could feel the frustrated expression on Amanda's face against the fuzz of the Cosmological Background Audio.

It seems she was done trying to extort information out of me and began taking actions again.

With her iron tight grip on both my legs, she began swinging me around.

After two or three spins, she released her grip and I went flying out of the platform.

As I hit the ground below, I rolled myself into a ball.

After my roll put me into the right position, I extended my legs and jumped back onto my feet.

A graceful landing.

My back was facing Amanda now.

I instinctively waved a goodbye to her without turning around as I walked to the benches to take a seat.

She followed after me shortly after.
