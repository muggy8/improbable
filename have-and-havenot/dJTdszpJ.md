# Proper Form

"Begin when ready" Ethan called in the exact same way he had the two previous rounds.

My eyes were focused on Melody and her oppenent. 

She did strike up a conversation with me so in a way, I was rooting for her.

She was extremely nervious when she left but I'm sure she'll be fine.

Her opponent seemed like a male variant of his species. 

He had horns on his head like the one Mikay has poking out of his forehead except this person had 2 of them.

I guess the fashion sense of this world is quite different.

Melody didn't immediately get into a combat stance but instead chatted away with the horned boy.

Unfortunately, they were too far away to hear. 

I honestly was quite curious at what her chatter was since I was rooting for her for she was the only person I had any interaction with here.

The conversation didn't last too long as Melody and the horned boy both got into some sort of fighting stance.

Melody was the first to strike. 

Compaired to her sister, Melody felt slow and slugish.

She charged at the horned boy and swung her fist at him.

He blocked her punch with ease but that wasn't the end.

Using the momentum of her run, Melody tackled the horned boy with her body.

But the horned boy was only pushed back slightly. 

Melody swung her arm around the horned boy's and seemed to be making her best attempt at pushing him but she doesn't seem to be making any progress.

As this happened, hhe horned boy made his move by kicking into her body as his hands were caught Melody's hold.

Melody took a hit, then another...

The third hit came and she flew off of the boy.

She didn't look like she was in good shape but she continued anyways.

She made the same approach as last time and the boy blocked her attack all the same.

She tackled him right after in the same way too but this time making much more progress.

Unfortunately, the one of the horned boy's arms were free this time and he pummled her with with his free arm and also kicked at her.

This time, things seemed different.

Melody made an attmept to push the horned boy to the side during his kick.

This seemed to have succeeded as the boy fell to his side.

During his fall, he grabbed Melody with his free hand and pulled her down too.

As the horned boy hit the floor back first, he also swung up a powerful kick and launched Melody off the platform.

I was dumbfounded.

Why did she make the exact same apprach as the first time.

The horned boy get up.

He then got off of the stage, helped Melody up off the floor and returned to the benches.

Melody did the same and sat down next to me again. 

She was quiet.

Melody's sister was the first to speak up.

"How's your body holding up?"

"I... I don't know..."

"You should have had strengthen active from the start."

"..."

"Did he kick you here?" Melody's sister asked while looking at where melody's hands were.

Melody noded in responce.

I didn't notice earlier but Melody had her hand on her stomach region the entire time.

Did Melody sustain some major damage?

"Should I let Ethan know you're hurt?" I asked.

But Melody shaked her head.

"No, it's fine."

"Are you sure? He's some sort of medical specialist or something. If you're hurt, you should at least get some first aid."

"You seem to be speaking in riddles Phanna. Anyways, just leave Melody to my care." 

Melody's sister cut me off and then began inspecting Melody. 

I wasn't exactly sure what she was doing but I left Melody and her sister to their own devices as I looked up to watch the other contestants.

There was only one single pair of fighters still fighting at this point. 

judging by the looks of it, they faught each other in much the same way that Melody and the horned boy were.

Sumo Boxing felt like an appropriate description. 

Eventually, the last fight ended with one contestant getting pushed off the platform.

Ethan made his round call again shortly after.
