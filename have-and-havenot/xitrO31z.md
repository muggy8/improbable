# Possession

"Master Mikay, thank you for your cooperation, the preparation is complete." Said the voice on the other end of the communicator.

"N-No problem, just doing my job."

"Ah, I see. You are truly a great asset to the league."

"Thank you."

"Alright then, I will begin the process of altering the memories of those who are currently within your Sphere of Influence."

As the person on the other side of the communicator finished those words, I could feel myself activating numerous Abilities.

I didn't recognize many of these Abilities.

I didn't even know what type of Abilities the ones I didn't recognize were.

All I know is that among the set that I didn't recognize, 4 of those were Innate Abilities.

It wasn't that surprising considering the person on the other end of this communicator was likely, at the very least, a Master or even a Grandmaster.

There were a few Abilities that I did recognize such as Observe and Investigate.

However, the events that followed felt like they came straight out of my nightmares to the point where I felt my stomach turning and my strength failing.

One by one, people around me fell to the floor unconscious.

Like a nightmarish reflection of the night, I lost Aurora and Hickory, 

Like the mission that we failed together as a team, no, as a family.

I felt my heartbreaking, as the memories of that night flooded my mind.

The students and teachers alike fell to the ground unable to resist whatever was happening.

And at the center of it all...

Was me.

"Wh... What's... What's happening..." I stuttered in horror.

"Do not be alarmed, this is all normal." The voice on the other side of the communicator comforted.

But that didn't register.

After all, this was how I lost my family before.

What will I lose this time?

My home?

My hope?

Me?

My mind flashed back to my earliest days of learning about Abilities and how to use them.

I would often play with the other kids at the time 

When we got into fights with the older kids, our group would use Influence Extention to fight the older kids.

"letting others use your Sphere of Influence as their own is a very powerful and dangerous tool. Just make sure the person you lend your Influence to is trustworthy." my teacher would often scold after these fights.

I later understood why that was the case but when did I become so careless again?

I should have asked who this person was and why this procedure needed to be done. 

But now, the only thing I can do is stand and watch.

I wanted to run away, but I couldn't move.

Was it because of the pain and fear, or was it because the person on the other side of the communicator used some kind of ability to immobilize me?

That, I did not know.

But I was frozen.

Stuck.

Cursed to watch as those around me fell one after another.

Until...

There was no one left standing.

I felt something wet running down one of my cheeks.

It's over...

Allover...

Again, I stand alone in a sea of corpses.

"Terminate Influence Extention," the voice on the other side of the communicator said as I felt my Sphere of Influence return to my control.

"Wha... What happened...?"

"It's as I said, the memories of these people have been altered slightly."

"Ar... Are they still alive..." I stuttered.

"Yes, they are all still alive and well. Please be at ease. They will all wake up in time."

"Bu... But why? Why do you need to do this?"

"That... Unfortunately, I cannot answer."

I was lost for words.

"Master Mikay, thank you for your cooperation. I will now ---" 

Before the person on the other side of the communicator can finish, I noticed Phanna sitting up in the middle of the platform. 

I dropped the communicator as I was stunned with relief.

As I released my grip on the communicator, my connection with the person on the other side of the communicator broke.

But the sound of the communicator hitting the gravel beneath my feet snapped me back into my senses.

I quickly rushed over to Phanna's side.

"Phanna! Phanna! Are you alright?!" I shouted as I got to Phanna's side.

But what I got back was just some groaning sounds and the typical noises Phanna would make to try to get me to go away in the morning.

The way Phanna does this made me feel complicated. 

It's hard to argue that Phanna isn't fine given the response just now, but the way Phanna is behaving is making things seem too fine.

To the point where I felt like maybe Phanna wasn't fine.

Phanna looked around blankly and quickly ended up scratching their head as they looked back at me sleepily.

"What am I doing here..." Phanna asked in a half-asleep way

Oh right, Phanna must not remember anything since everyone's memories were altered just now.

"Um, Phanna, what do you remember?" I asked trying to find out what was the new sequence of events that everyone is supposed to remember now.

"I'm not quite sure... I'm getting this memory alteration warning right now... actually... let me just get that warning to go away first. User memory merge backup overwrite."

I wasn't sure if I understood much of what Phanna said at all.

This definately wasn't the first time I felt this way.

Phanna might as well be speaking complete gibberish by the end.

I've gotten really good at ignoring Phanna's nonsense most of the time now, but even I knew this wasn't the time and place to just ignore the gibberish.

The only thing I really understood was that Phanna's memories are messed up.

Should I ask Phanna to actually explain and risk an even more messy answer?

But Phanna has given understandable explanations before...

Before I can make up my mind on what to do, Phanna gripped their forehead with their hand.

I could see the discomfort in Phanna's face.

"Are you alright?!"  I shouted as I quickly grabbed onto Phanna's shoulders.

But the response I got was much less comforting this time around.
