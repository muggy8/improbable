# Cold Truth

"Master Mikay, thank you for your cooperation, the preperation is complete." Said the voice on  the other end of the communicator.

"N-No problem, just doing my job."

"Ah I see. You are truly a great asset to the league."

"Thank you."

"Alright then, I shall now begin the process of altering the memories of those who are currently withing your Sphere of Influence."

As the person on the other side of the communicator finished those words, I could feel numurous abilities being activated.

I didn't recognize many of these Abilities.

I didn't even know what type of Abilities the ones i didn't recognize were.

All i know is that among the set that I didn't recognize, 4 of those were Innate Abilities.

Not surprising considering the person on the other end of this communicator was likely at the very least a Grandmaster.

There were a few Abilities that I did recongies such as Observe and Investigate.

However, the events that followed felt like they came strait out of my nightmares to the point where I felt my stomach turning and my strength faiding.

One by one, people around me fell to the floor uncontious.

Like a nightmarish refelction of the night I lost Aurora and Hickory, 

Like the mission that we failed together as a team, no, as a family.

I felt my heart breaking, as the memories of that night flooded my mind.

The students and teachers alike fell to the ground unable to resist whatever was happening.

And at the center of it all...

Was me.

"Wh.... What's... What's happening..." I stuttered in horror.

"Do not be alarmed, this is all normal." The voice on the other side of the communicator comforted.

But that didn't register.

After all, this was how I lost my family before.

What will i lose this time?

My home?

My hope?

Me?

My mind flashed back to my earliest days of learning about Abilities and how to use them.

I would often play with the other kids at the time 

When we got into fights with the older kids, our group would use Inflence Extention to fight the older kids.

"letting others use your Sphere of Influence as their own is a very powerful and dangerous tool. Just make sure the person you lend your Influence to is trustworthy." my teacher would often scold after these fights.

I later understood why that was the case but when did I become so careless again?

I should have asked who this person was and why this procedure needed to be done. 

But now, the only thing i can do is stand and watch.

I wanted to run away, but I couldn't move.

Was it because of the pain and fear, or was it because the person on the other side of the communicator used some kind of ability to imbalize me?

That, I did not know.

But I was frozen.

Stuck.

Cursed to watch as those around me fell one after another.

Untill...

There was no one left standing.

I felt a tear run down my cheeks.

It's over...

All over...

Again, I stand alone in a sea of corpses.

"Terminate Influence Extention" the voice on the other side of the communicator said and I could feel my Sphere of Influence returning to my control.

"Wha... What happened...?"

"It's as I said, the memories of these people have been altered slightly."

"Ar... Are they still alive..." I stuttered.

"Yes, they are all still alive and well. Please be at ease. They will all wake up in time."

"Bu... But why? Why do you need to do this?"

"That... Unfortunately, I cannot answer."

I was lost for words.

"Master Mikay, thank you for your cooperation ---" 

I dropped the communicator as I looked in awe towards Phanna's direction resulting in dissconnecting my communicator link to the person on the other side of the communicator.
