prologue: dark matter and dark energy | introduction of magic system

arc 1: wiled west of the dimensional revolution outlaws | within a few decades of the key discovery where nano applications of the tech becomes sorta viable.

arc 2: wiled west of the dimensional revolution enforcers | happening within the same era as arc 1, this is a tale of the enforcers where some of the characters from arc 1 makes a return

arc 3: Birth and Life of a Dragon | Genetic engineering is common place and so is nano tech allowing most average person access to really powerful tools and even probability manipulation. However despite being everywhere they are still weakened or even completely destroyed by strong enough EM burst. Thus the birth of a new breed who can wield the power of probability and nano tech thought biological processes was engineered.

arc 4: dependents of the dragon | This happens a 1.5-3 hundred years after the birth of the first dragon. There are a number of true "Dragon"s in the world by now. The construction of the orbital ring multi-step structure is also nearing it's completion and marks the beginning of human expansion into space

Idea tank:
outlaws developed quantum computing is and using it to do nefarious stuff and the enforcers are ones who had to rely on the power of artificial general intelligence to combat the outlaws. They knew very well that there was a good chance that humans would be lost to the oncoming battle between the two new world powers but that did not deter them from doing so. they made backup plans and settled up a manned space base across the solar system until the day the decedents of the humans can one day return to earth. They would be the one to be the keepers of humanity's knoweldge base should anything happen that jeopardized such things.

The ensewing war between the people of quantum computation and the classical super mind resulted...

hundreds of years later...

On one of the space stations located at the L3 Lagrange point, one of final known bastions of humanity remained. They were tasked like many of the other expeditioners that they were to be a safeguard for the future and to keep the knowledge and past of humanity safe. Throughout the years, many of the other communication beacons were lost in one way or another. and since they had no way of seeing what was happening on the earth, they were unable to confirm what exactly is happening. After the fall of the only other beacon they were able to spot, they decided that it was only a matter of time before they too would find themselves at the mercy of whatever destroyed the others. This resulted in the research and creation of a genetically altered human that is able perform probabilistic manipulations using biological means as a safe guard against whatever is on the offensive. This was their trump card and with that, they plan on re-claiming the earth and reinstating humans back to it's rightful place.
