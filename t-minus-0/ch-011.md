# Chapter 11

"Do I look like Pillow to you?" Mikay answered aggressively.

"Not really but that was more of just an inside joke." I said 

Mikay didn't look too impressed so I countinued to explain.

"You see, in my world, not everything is biologically immortal. we humans are but our pets often aren't. That's why our civilizations have ways of giving biological immortality to our pets as an option of keeping them around forever."

"Oh..."

Mikay gave me a nod as i continued.

"I dont exactly have everything needed to pull this off but i do happen know how it works in theory. that's why, with enough time, I should be able to figure it out."

"wait wait wait. are you offering to grant me immortality?"

"Biological immortality. there's a difference." I sighed. 

"Right."

"But yes and no. what  i'm offering is that I will try to grant you biological immortality as I dont know if it'll succeed or not. This way you can do this whole saving your daughter thing yourself and you can take as long as you need to."

Mikay seemed to be lost in thought as he looked down at his grip on my hand.

It does sound like a pretty good plan right?

"What's the catch?" he asked looking back up at me.

"Hun what do you mean what's the catch?"

"You wouldn't just be offering something as valueable as giving someone  im- biological immortality without asking for something extremely valueable in return."

"hmm?" I looked at him puzzled before continueing.

"Well if you are asking for what i get from doing this then nothing really in our world, we strongly believe the free flow of information and almost all inforamation is free to anyone to use or make use of."

Mikay had a look of disbelief on his face.

"I... I dont quite believe that you'd offer do this without getting anything in return."

"Why not? I did agree to help you 'save' your daughter right? I cant exactly do any fighting nor do i want to. but if you can do the fighting youself when you're no longer confined by your age then I wont have to risky my life with trying to help you save your daughter."

"Well...."

"And besides, I still do expect you to teach me the ability magic of your world."

"Right..."

Mikay's seems to be lost in thought as he stairs at the grip he has on my hand again. 

What's he thinking of this time.

He's clearly considering something but mind hacking isn't really something i did before. 

Maybe I should consider downloading a few mind hacking knowledge packs once i return home.

That said, considering the people here dont really have a digital substraits, mind hacking might not be useful at all here. 

"So what you're saying is your willing to give me this biological immortality if you dont have to fight anymore?"

"Well I didn't say I'll be able to give you biological immortality. I just said that i'm willing to try to make it happen. I wont know if I'll be able to do it till I actually give it a few tries."

"Ooh..." Mikay said dissapointingly.

"I guess if you must think of everything as an exchange then sure w can say you're propsal is spot on. it just so happens that right now, I'm not really intrested in dying. I'll submit a formal application when I'm ready to do that. we'll say that If I successfully make you biologically immortal, you'll agree to avoid making me fight any fights that i dont have to. Deal?"

"Hmmm... I guess i can agree to that." said Mikay as he let go of my hand.

"I guess i'll have to keep a sizeable portion of my P-Particles for myself if i do end up beocming immortal."

"Biologically immortal." i sighed. 

I guess my assumption was right, him holding onto my hand is indeed what is allowing him to transfer these P-Particle things into my body. 

"I was planning on giving you almost all of my P-Particles but if what you're saying is true then the amount i gave you already is probably near the ideal split."

"Oh? I'll probably be able to create more P-Particles eventually so keeping what you need for yourself is a good idea."

"Creating P-Particles? is that even possiable?"

"As long as it doesn't require quantum cloning then should be."

"What?"

"Uh... forget I said anything"

Right, trying to explain anything beyond the  bare minimum is going to be a trying exercise.
