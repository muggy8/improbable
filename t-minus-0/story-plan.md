Need to fit in to ch 4: legend of the world


story arcs:
 - learning about the world and world building and building the relationship between Mikay and Phanna as well as more background of what Mikay's mistake was.
 - The class at the mastery academy (which phanna didn't end up going to) bit off more than they can chew and needs to be rescued (major development: phanna decides to step into danger to help them despite not wanting to do that)
 - The elven Tribe (not sure but i had a crazy idea of what the elves of this world would be like and I wanted an arc to explore that before the story ramps up for the major ending).
 - somewhere around now too, Phanna will figure out the true nature of the summoning ritual and that there is no way of returning home. this arc may end up as a part of the elvin tribes arc.
 - A run in with the Master League. at this time the story world and stuff is quite well known and them major factions are somewhat defined. This arc will start off with Mikay feeling confident in a plan to save his daughter and then make an attempt to do so with phanna in tow. The plan fails and it's also at this time that Mikay will get killed off by the mastery league. in the aftermath of that, phanna will taking up mikay's mission to save his daughter except slightly differently.
 - At this point, the Mastery League is now fully against Phanna's existence is actively hunting them down. this part will have various attempts to either solicit Phanna into the league and when that fails, strait up attacks. Eventually, it will result in Phanna joining forces with the Phantom Lords and becoming an official member of Phantom Lords
 - Phanna then learns about the true nature of the Phantom Lords as it's a segmented group with various ideologies and actions. Partially because of living in the town that Mikay has acted as guardian over for, Phanna becomes the new guardian of that land in a way fulfilling the promise to save Hickory.
 - After inheriting mikay's role and so on, Phanna began search for the reason why the world is so abnormal in every way and evetually un covering the history of the world, how it came to be.
 - After some number of years some new Phantom Lords have appeared directly or indirectly due to the influence of Phanna and as a result, the Mastery Guild is no longer able to just let the Phantom Lords exist as they are on the verge of threatening the dominance and stability of the system that the league has set up. as a result, the league started an operation to actively eliminate the Phantom Lords via any means necessary which brings the Phantom Lords together for the first time ever against a common foe and the war that ensues.
 - After destroying the League, phanna comes against overwhelming opposition of the functional god of this world and the source of P-Particles and fights against this being to a loss. however after some reasoning with this being, the souce of all P-Particles has taken an interest in Phanna as they were able to do the unthinkable on many occasions and decides to let phanna be with the exception that they must prove that the world they come from can exist by transforming the territory that they curently own into a mini replica of phanna's home world. Phanna then spends the rest of the arc developing the town and making full use of all the abilities at their disposal.
 - Phanna after replicating the world that they came from has not yet seen any traces of the Source of all P-Particles and hence embarks on a journy to find this being and eventually only finds that this being has departed from the current timeline as they have seen what Phanna is capable of and is fully willing to entrust the future of that time line into Phanna's hands
