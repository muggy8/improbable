# Chapter 1: Match Made Across Quantum Space-Time

<img src="~" width="600px" height="250px" alt="(Image: A wooden room with the point of view seemingly in the top corner near the door as there's no door in the frame. On the far side of the wall there's a large glass container with a glass lid over it. This container has various markings on it made with some dark red pigment. There seems to be a person sleeping in the glass box. A pretty normal looking wooden desk with a drawer to the right of the desk is located at the middle of the wall to the right of the glass box. A glass bin is underneath the desk, a window above it, and an ornate wooden chair in-front of it. By the wall to the right of a big glass box is a bed with an old man sleeping on it and a circular blue blob right next to him.)" />

"Thanks for holding down the fort, Pillow" I said as I awaken from my mid day nap.

"Still nothing?" I asked as if expecting a reply but who am I kidding, Pillow's a slime blob with no way of communicating. It can't possibly reply.

Though that may be the case, having it on watch is probably still a good idea since it'll surly cause a ruckus if someone did show up.

Or so I had thought as I looked over to the aquarium that Pillow normally hangs around in fully expecting it to be empty only to find a slender person sleeping there.

A few days earlier, I had the aquarium drained and then performed the summoning preparations onto it as I had done before.

I inscribed onto it a summoning circle with the standard summoning conditions.

Well, only sort of the same preparations as before. I had no idea how well things will work out this time around since summoning rituals aren't normally done inside an aquarium ever.

But the last person I summoned seemed to have mentioned something about vaccination or quarantine before he died.

I'm not sure what either of those things are but I thought I should at least set up a safe space for the summoned this time around. Maybe it'll boost the odds of survival.

That's why I had no idea how long the summoning ritual will last for or if it'll even work at all because of how strangely the summoning ritual was performed.

But to my surprise, it looks like the summoning ritual had worked normally.  Nothing was too out of the ordinary... the only problem is that this one doesn't seem like any humanoid I've ever seen...

This one's got long pointy ears like an elf as well as another set of fox like ears that points straight up.

The black fox like ears also seem to blend right into the summoned's shiny black hair.

This is the first time I've ever seen such a strange setup in any humanoid ever but that's really not much of a concern to me.

...

After inspecting the summoned for a while, I turned around and looked over to Pillow who's lazing around as usual.

"Hey Pillow~ Did you know? someone's invaded your room? Why didn't you tell me about it~?" I asked Pillow playfully.

Of course, no response as usual, though I did get a jiggle out of it when I called it's name.

Thinking about it, I haven't really fed Pillow in a few days now so maybe it's just low on energy? But aren't you only supposed to feed a slime once a week?

Maybe a bit of food will help it out.

Thinking this, I picked Pillow up and placed it inside a glass garbage bin.

"Eat up Pillow."

In a short while Pillow's smooth and silky exterior changed to become slimy and sticky.

Things it touched got pulled into it's body and pretty soon, all the trash in the bin got consumed and Pillow returned to it's original smooth and silky state.

I lifted Pillow out of the trash bin and caught sight of the summoned sitting up inside the aquarium.

I walked over to the aquarium making sure to make my presence known.

The last time I approached carelessly, I got accused of being a "jump scare".

I don't know what that is but it definitely doesn't sound like something I'd want to get associated with.

"Hello, My name's Mikay, how are you feeling?" I asked.

The summoned looked over sleepily and mumbled something "name? Mickay? I guess we're in that kind of simulation now."

"Simulation?" I asked in confusion.

The summoned seems really out of it. I guess it's to be expected. After all, who does summoning procedures in an aquarium.

It wouldn't be too out there to think that something did go wrong with the summoning ritual.

"I don't know what this simulation you speak of is but I'm pretty sure that whatever it is, this place isn't it."

"Oh you heard that? You're not supposed to hear it. Just forget it ok?"

The summoned then made an extremely dismissive hand gesture at me.

I remember I used to get pretty displeased at the kind of treatment I'm getting but right now, it really doesn't bother me much.

I noticed that the summoned is looking intently at Pillow.

"Um..."

Just as I was planning on saying something, the summoned made another comment completely out of the blue.

"Hey, you who's named Mickay, I'm about to say some really weird stuff. please ignore them ok?"

"o-ok..."

What came next was indeed the weirdest comments I've ever seen someone make. It's as if the summoned was whispering orders to some invisible entity.

"user get_location"

...

"root get_location"

...

"root ping"

...

"root thought_boost 10 and debug"

The summoned then fell over in the aquarium.

"Hay are you ok in there."

"User A244XZ4305PHAN4 is currently in stasis. Please wait for user to exit stasis"

This reply that came sounded almost inhuman.

It was flat and monotonous and the tempo of the words was absolutely flat as well.

It's as if the summoned's soul was ripped out and the remaining body was then possessed by something unnatural and otherworldly.

What could have caused this.

Did the summoning ritual in the aquarium end in failure?

Is it back to square one?

But what can I change?

Maybe more P-Particles?

But before I could really follow the chain of thought any further, the summoned sat up again this time seemingly much more alert than the last.

"You who address yourself as Mikay. I don't know who you are or what you've done but you seem to have done the impossible. Whatever you did, you need to tell me everything about it. From the looks of it, new discoveries are waiting to be made."

I stood there stunned by the sudden change in tone with no idea how to respond.

That said, things sounded serious.

Maybe the summoning process is only a partial failure?

"So what do you want to know about?"

"Everything!" said the summoned with a determined look.

I don't know what but something must have happened during the short time the summoned fell over.

Either way, I'll need to make the most out of this situation.

I made a gesture with my body as if to think over the request and then responded.

"I'm willing to do that but I'm gonna need you to do me a favor in return. You see my daughter has currently defected and became a Phantom Lord, I'm gonna need your help to recover..."

"Deal!"

Well that was faster than expected.

I thought I'd get questioned a lot more before I got any response.

"You're not... know what whatever. Anyways, before I begin, do you have a name I can call you by."

I put Pillow down on the floor and sat down on a near by chair.

"Name... now that's a concept I haven't heard of for a long time. My universal identification code is 'A244XZ4305PHAN4'. But PHAN4 is unique withing my district so most people address me as that."

"That's a mouthful. How do you and your people communicate efficiently?"

"Well normally we just use the smallest set of characters that is locally unique to a group or area. So between just us, I'd be 4 and you'd be Kay. If you were Kay4 then I'd be N4 and..."

"Hold on, hold on, hold on..."

"Hmm?"

"Whatever your culture does is interesting and all but I just needed to know how to address you."

"Probably just 4 then" said 4 with a shrug

"That'd make things inconvenient."

4 shrugged again...

"No no this won't do, I can't call you that in front of everyone else."

"I haven't had a problem with it yet"

"I know, that's the scary part..."

"You knew?"

"Well if you have problems with it, the system clearly wouldn't have stuck around for too long"

"Oh. you're mistaken. People do have problems with it in other places. But..."

"heh?!"

"Well you're one of those degenerates who don't understand the elegance of the Reduction Protocol so I gotta school you a little"

"Degenerate? Reduction Protocol? School?"

"err... um... ok never mind, don't worry about it."

4 made a strange face. Probably expected a different response.

"Anyways, if you want me to have a proper 'name', you're gonna have to think of one yourself. I'm perfectly content with PHAN4"

"PHAN4... What about Phanna? Are you ok with the name Phanna?"

"I don't care. I'm not going to be addressing myself, you're the one who's going to be using it the most so as long as you like it, I don't really care"

"I'll take that as a yes then. Starting today, you'll be known as Phanna!"

"Sure sure."

Phanna shrugged once again and this time, the shrug is accompanied by an eye roll.

"So now that you're done asking your question, I got one to ask back. Is the air content withing this glass enclosure the same as the air content outside?"

"I'm not sure what that means but it should have the same air as outside."

"Right, so you kinda just put a lid on this box and later I showed up in here right?" Phanna said with a slightly accusatory tone

"Sounds about right."

"So why is this container air tight? The oxygen level in here drop by .33%"

"Oxygen? Air tight?"

Phanna made an expression of disbelief but I quickly continued,

"The whole point of this box is to keep you from dying. The last person I summoned died and before he did, he was talking about isolation or vaccine or something. So I thought I should do this to improve your odds of survival"

"Ah, I see, that'd make a lot more sense then. User set_state communicative_stasis"

With that Phanna fell over again much like the first time

Again?! I panicked

"Phanna?!"

"Calm down Mikay, I'm just in stasis, nothing to worry about."

"W-what's stasis"

"Well it means a lot of things but at the moment, it just means I reduced most of my body's functions to conserve energy, I should be able to remain conscious for 2-3 times longer in stasis."

"Right... about that drop in this Oxygen concentration you mentioned earlier?"

"Right I'm trying to think of a solution too..."

"No I mean what is it?"

There was a long pause before Phanna replied,

"You see, there are many types of air and they all exist in harmony. Oxygen is one of those types and when the balance is off, bad stuff happens."

"Do you take me for a child?"

The nerves on this kid.

It takes alot to get me worked up these days but this kid is definitely getting me worked up.

"Well if you're going to ask questions like a child then I'm gonna answer them as if you were one."

"From the looks of it, you're the child here!"

"I don't doubt that but age doesn't really matter after a certain point to an extent."

That comment brought me back down to earth as I reflected on my situation and quickly calmed down.

"It does for me..."

Phanna seems awfully confused at this whole situation, or what could be considered as confused given majority Phanna's facial movements seemed to be disabled by this stasis thing.

"Go on..."

"I've made many mistakes. The biggest of which is allowing my daughter to abandon her position as the strongest Grandmaster and becoming a Phantom Lord. That's why I have to save her and to tell her sorry... but I'm already nearing my 70s in age and am unable to do this myself. That's why I need you, people like you, people of a different world with unlimited wisdom and..."

"Hahahahahahahaha. You talk like you're about to die but you're not even 70? That's got to be a joke right?"

"N-no I'm quite serious."

"Look Mikay, I'm around 800 years old right now. I'll have to check with my system records to know exactly how old but I can tell you, I've never herd of people dying before 150 and even that was an extremely rare accident."

Phanna's face is as still as ever. It's impossible to tell whether that comment was made in jest or not.

"No way, whatever you're saying is impossible..." I replied

"No. What you're saying is actually what's impossible." Phanna barked back.

Maybe the whole stasis thing is all a lie and it's all just a clever way to get me angered...

"Although what you say sound completely impossible, it also doesn't seem like you're lying to me."

"Of course I'm not lying! What do I have to gain from lying?" I snarled.

"So tell me, what's going to kill you?"

"Kill me? Nothing's gonna kill me, I'm just old and frail now"

"Right dying of old age, next you're gonna tell me your parents are already dead"

"..."

"..."

"..."

"user set_state normal and user set_state digital_thought."

Phanna sat up again and stared at me with a serious and intense look.

I stared back with the same intensity.

We both remained there looking at each other for maybe a couple minutes; maybe a couple seconds. It's hard to tell at this point.

"I can't believe you're serious..." Phanna finally murmured followed by "user set_state communicative_stasis" and, for the third time, fell over.

I feel like I'm starting to get used to this but it still startles me.

"So is this the reason you want me to help with 'recovering' your daughter right?"

"Right."

"I'm sorta envious to be honest. People where I'm from don't just die unless they are killed and even then, it's very difficult. That's why people have to apply for death. Having a set time on how much life you have sounds nice. It'd surely make me value my time more."

"Unlimited lifespan... seems nice... imagine all the stuff you can do with all that time"

Phanna gave off a chuckle

"It might be nice in the beginning but at some point, everything that could be done has been done already. At that point, no one has any uniqueness and everything is just a copy of something else. It's still nice to enjoy the things around but the thing is, everything that can be experienced is just a rehash of another thing. That's why I started studying sciences in order to discover something unique to be the only one to be able to experience discovering this something new..."

"Did you succeed?"

"Why do you think I'm here?"

"I don't know, the summoning ritual only makes sure that we can speak the same language and the person who is summoned is willing to be summoned"

"Summoning? What is this? A game?"

"Do you still think we're all still this simulation thing?"

"No it's quite apparent that this isn't a simulation. I checked earlier. The Cosmic Background Audio is completely different. not only that, I cant connect to the Central Compute Cluster at all. there's very few ways of..."

"Alright I'm just gonna stop you right there. You're not making any sense right now."

"Eh..."

Phanna doesn't seem impressed, and honestly neither am I.

"Well anyways, to get back to your question, we did succeed in creating a biological way of observing gravitational waves but we were too late. A similar technology was given to our planet during the technology exchange as we did a fly by of another star system that already had intelligent life on it..."

"We?"

"I wasn't alone... I had 2 co-researchers... had..."

"I'm sorry..."

"They were the first ones I've ever seen die... "

It's hard to make out what's happening from the stasis but I think Phanna's crying right now.

"Do you need some time alone?"

"..."

I got up off my chair and noticed Pillow lazing around on the floor as usual.

I picked up Pillow and left the room.
