# Chapter 1: Match Made Across Quantum SpaceTime

"Thanks for holding down the fort, Pillow" I said as I awaken from my nap. 

"Still nothing?" I asked as if expecting a reply but who am I kidding, Pillow's a slime blob. It can't possibly reply. 

Though that may be the case, having it on watch is still a good idea since it'll be sure to make a ruckus if someone did show up. 

Or so I had thought as I looked over to the aquarium that Pillow normally hangs around in only to find a slender person sleeping there. 

A few days earlier, I had the aquarium drained and performed the summoning preperations as I had a few times before.

I inscribed a summoning circle on it and set up the summoning chant as wsll.

Well only sorta the same as before. I had no idea how well this'll work this time around since it isn't normallydone in an aquarium ever.

But the last person summoned seemed to have mentioned something about vaccination or quainteen before he died so I'm completely in the unknown this time around. 

I thought I'd at least set up a sort of safe zone for the summoned this time around. Maybe it'll boost the odds of survival. 

That's why I had no idea how long the summoning ritual will last for or even if it'll resolve or not. 

But to my supprise, it worked like normal. Nothing's too out of the ordinary... only that this one doesn't seem quite as human... or even demi-human for that matter.

This one's got long elf like ears where you'd normally expect to find ears as well as another set of fox like ears on top.

This is the first time I've ever seen such a strange setup in any human or demi-humans ever.

...

After inspecting the summoned for a while, I turned around and looked over to Pillow who's lazing around as usual. 

"Hey Pillow~ Did you know? someone's invaded your room? Why didn't you tell me about it~?" I asked Pillow playfully.

Of course no response as usual, though I did get a jiggle out of it when I called it's name.

Thinking about it, I haven't really fed Pillow in a few days now so maybe it's just low on energy? But aren't you only supposed to feed slimes once a week?

Maybe a bit of food will help it out. 

Thinking this, I picked up Pillow and placed it inside a glass garbage bin.

"Eat up Pillow."

In a short while Pillow's exterior changed from smooth and silky to slimy and sticky. 

Things it touched got pulled into it's body and pretty soon, all the trash in the bin got consumed and Pillow returned to it's original smooth and silky state.

I lifted Pillow out of the trash bin and caught sight of the summoned sitting up inside the aquarium.

I walked over to the aquarium making sure to make my presence known hoping to avoid accidentally become a "jump scare" as one of the previous summoned mentioned. 

"Hello, My name's Mickay, how are you feeling?" I asked.

The summoned looked over sleepily and mumbled something  "name? Mickay? I guess we're in that kind of simulation now."

"Simulation?" I asked as a thought rolled across my mind.

This is the most uncooperative person I've ever summoned. 

I guess it's to be expected. After all, who does summoning procedures in an aquarium. 

"I don't know what this simulation you speak of is but I can assure you that we're not whatever this simulation thing you think we are."

"Oh you herd that? You're not supposed to hear it. Just forget it ok?"

The summoned then made an extremely dismissive hand gesture at me.

I guess I'll play along. I've got nothing to lose anyways. 

but that's then the summoned made another comment completely out of the blue

"Hey mickay, I'm about to say some really weird stuff. please ignore them ok?"

"o-ok..."
