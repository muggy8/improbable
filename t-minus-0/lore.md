## Abilities: 
there's 3 main types of abilities in the world at this point. Common Abilities, Innate Ability and Primordial Abilities. All abilites opperates on a similar principle, as long as whatever target you're opperating on is within the opperator's spear of influence and are under mostly their infulence they can opperate on it. however once the effect leaves the opperator'e spear of influence, the effect will propigate by the normal laws of nature. (see more on innate abilities to understand how they work)


## Common Abilities:
these are what's thought to be the simplest abilities using the P-Particles that anyone with enoug practice can obtain. in theory anyone with enough time can master all common abilitres. however in practice most people only really master a small subset of all possiable common abilities. Common abilities are often seen as degraded versions of Innate Abilities but that's not the case. they are often just less efficent or less potent versions created by the people later on in immitating Innate Abilities which is why they are much more accessable than Innate abilities. however sometimes, every so often, some common ability are built better than the innate ability that it's based off of. Common abilities are initially built by people who have previousely owned a Innate Ability and created versions easier to access. this process happens subcontiously and is often passed onto the people who they commonly come into contact with. because of this. there's much less number of common abilities than innate abilities and hence it's much easier for people to have the same common ability. since innate abilities are much harder to get and not that many has been obtained throughout history meaning there's a lot less common abilities than innate ones. hence why it's often known as "common abilities" as it's common for many people to have the same abilities. it is worth noting that some extremely widely used Common Ability such as Iron Skin, Focus Energy and Self Regeneration have become stronger over time as it's used by countless generations of people and enhanced subcontiously over time that they are often stronger than their innate counter parts. Since Common abilities are based on innate abilities they do have a cap to around equal to that of innate abilities. as such, they will never be stronger than a primordial ability.


## Innate Abilities: 
these are the degraded versions of abilities that are originally created by the source of all P-Particles and the master of all abilities. they often hard to acquire and master. those with Innate Skill have to put significant effort into obtaining them and many will spend their whole lives without ever having one. As such, people with innate abilies are well respected and those with more than one are rare and even more respected and even feared. the ownership of innate abilities became the one of the basis for elegibility into various dangerous positions such as law enforcement, military, desaster resuce, etc. though it's not the only way to qualify, it's the most sure fire way to qualify. on the story's mainland, there's a guild known as the Guild of Mastery which collects people with innate abilities and ranks them as well as lones them out to parties who are in need of powerful indiviuals for various tasks too dangerous for their normal staff such as busting crim syndicates or overseeing riots. they are also trained to be stronger and some even gain additioal innate abilities while training with them. 

generally, innate abilities are thought to be unique in that there cannot be dupdicates of it but that's actually false. given the same circumstances, experiance, p-particle count and type and various other aspects,, 2 people can manifest the same innate ability. however the possibtility of that is extremely slim as it's theorized that there's more unique innate abities than there are stars in the skys as legend has it that innate abilities originate from star fragments fallen from the heavens. however this isn't true, innate abilities are just short cuts to spicific combinations for things that the P-Particles do (like Macros / hot keys) and if people know how to opperate and interact with P-Particles, they can manually re-create these.


## Primordial Abilities: 
these abilities are carbon copies of abilities of the stars as legend says. but in reality they are the exact abilities created by the creator of abilities. because of it's power, holders of primordial abilities are often feared and respected. those who posess on or more of this class of ability is instantly elegable to be a "grand master" within the Guid of Mastery (the alternate requirement is to own 5 or more innate abilities). grand masters are theorized to be able to destroy a country by themselves but since many countries have at least one grandmaster belonging to them, this has yet to be proven. thos who do not have a grandmaster's protection will have a Phantom Lord's protection since not having any protection would mean the country would be annexed easily. 

## Phantom Lords: 
Phantom Lords are called such because on paper, they shouldn't be able to exist but they do. These are indiviuals who fit the quiteria for being a grandmaster but for one reason or another, isn't one. In the current time of the story, the strongest Grandmaster, holder of 3 primordial abilities, Hickory, decided one day to stop being a grandmaster and renounced their title of grandmaster and currently is the strongest of the Phantom Lords. All Phantom Lords are kept a close eye on by  the guild of mastery as they are a powerful group that can rival the guild and cannot be forced into submission. There's 3 tiers of Phantom Lords however most people don't know about it. the first tier is know as the self proclamed Phantom Lord. these are powerful indiviuals who do not nesessarily fit the official quiteria of being a phantom lord but are still quite powerful. they however have gaind the approval of various other phantom lords and are allowed to proclaim themselves as such. the second type of phantom lord is an untested phantom lord. these are people who do fit the requirement but hasn't faught a grandmaster yet. majority of the higher ranking and more well known phantom lords are untested including Hickory. The final type of Phantom Lords are know as Tempered Phantom Lords as they have encountered, faught and survived (often through defeating the opposition) one or more grandmaster. because of how the definitions are, it is possiable to be a tempered self-proclaimed phantom lord however these are very rare and there's only one around currently as having a primordial ability or 5 or more innate abilities are seen as a must in order to even stand toe to toe with a grandmaster.
