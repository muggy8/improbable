## Unnamed

## A244XZ4305PHAN4

Gender: N/A

Age: 700-800

Description: A244XZ4305PHAN4 is the serial ID of the person who is summoned to the world. they come from a distant future where humanity has mastered technology to the point of everyone having biological immortality. To prevent overpopulation people has long since been genetically engeneered to not be able to reprodoce normally anymore. A244XZ4305PHAN4 Gains the name Phanna Zaeso from their summoner

Motive: To do something worthwhile.

Backstory: A244XZ4305PHAN4 wanted to do be someone rather than just a kog in the machine. the world that they're from is a "paradice" esque world where there's no hunger or pain, people live forever and machines automate every job. their home world is a matrioshika world not bound to a star and has a black hole at it's center powering it. the sector they live in is only 10% the surface area of the planet's shell at that level with a population of over 5 hundred trillion people. before being summoned, A244XZ4305PHAN4 spent a couple centries researching the posibility of creating a system that can be intigrated with biological processes to observe gravitational waves and was later on successful. however during a flyby of another star system, they discovered that the research that they've done for the past couple centries was a well known fact taught in physics 101 on that planet. feeling like there's no meaning to their existance they were later randomly offered to be wisked away to a different world with new experiances to which they accepted isekai'd to the current narrative world

Failures: because A244XZ4305PHAN4 lived in a post scaricity civilization, they do not understand the reality of the new world they're in and trusts people way too easily. they also completely lacks common sense. after their first incident of being trusting backfires, they become increadibdy untrusting and suspicious of everyone and everything overanalyzing things resulting in them refusing legitimate help later on. this results in the death of a close friend (potential love intrest?). and triggers them to become a Phantom Lord

Story: A244XZ4305PHAN4 initially was gifted a number of P-Particles enough to be an avarage of Level 2 by their summoner. they later on learned the roaps of the Manip techniques and mastered a few Common Abilities and earned their first Innate Ability Electromancer, a variant of the asummoner's Innate Ability, Arsonist (plasma ability). A244XZ4305PHAN4 later on earns 3 more Innate Abilities one of them being Sky Walker (gas ability
) and a liquid and solid ability.  After that using their futuristic knowledge, they figures out the secrets of P-Particles and manually creates the Star Walker ability based on Sky Walker which is akin to a Primordial Ability becoming the first to own a Original Ability. in the mean time, they also help another grandmaster create another Original Ability which results in betrail and a huge battle to which resulted in the defeat of the other grand master and Phanna quitting the mastery ranking. During that battle, Phanna awakened Primordial Electromancer and unknowingly officially becomes a Phantom Lord.
