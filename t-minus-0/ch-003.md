# Chapter 3: Title in Progress.
I made my way to the front of my home and opened the door. 

As expected, Ethan was standing there before me with a gleeful smile.

"Thanks for coming over on such short notice Ethan."
 
"No no it's my honor to be of service to you."

"Please come in, also shoes off please as usual."

Ethan did as I asked and entered my home.

"So where's Phanna?"

"In the aquarium."

"Oh?"

"Appearently that's a bad idea since the auuarium this 'air tight' thing and poses a greater risk than not having it. have you herd of such a thing before?"

"Unfortunately I haven't..."

We made our way to Phanna's room and as expected Phanna's laying motionless in the aquarium. 

"Is that... Phanna?"

"Yup"

We made our way over to the edge of the aquarium with Phanna still remaining motionless.

Ethan's face show clear signs of unrest starting from the moment we stepped into this room and woresened as we approached the glass box.

"Are you sure your apprentice is still alive?"

Before I got the chance to answer, Phanna responded with a voice full of disappointment.

"I'm quite alive, thank you very much."

Ethan, rather startled by Phanna's remake let out a yelp

"I don't quite recognize your voice. I'm guessing your the cleric that Mikay alluded to earlier?"

"T-that's right, my name is Ethan, I'm a Master with 3 Innate abilities. How do you do?"

Ethan clumsily gave his intro completely fumbling just about everything.

I'm not quite sure why he's so nervious or scared but whatever.

"Master? and I'm gonna assume that this innate ability isn't what I think it is..."

Phanna's answer seems completely unimpressed hence why I stepped in here to do some explaining.

"Panna, abilities are what allows us to defy the natrual laws of the world."

"So magic?"

"You can call it that I suppose. Innate abilities are quite rare and Ethan here possess 3 of them which makes him a Master. Fortunately 2 of his innate abilities are useful for healing which is why he's here"

"..."

"I'm gonna have him examine you now."

"Right... and if you are I'm going to examine me I'm going to examine you too. user initiate wave receivers cache"

Ethan looked at me rather confused and I too returned the gaze with a shrug.

"Just ignore that and proceed." I said Ethan.

Phanna doesn't seem to care about what I said it seems and made no responces. 

"Y-yes Master Mikay!"

Ethan then stood in front of the glass box and centered on Phanna's body with both hands reaching forwords palms touching the glass.

"I'm starting now." Ethan then said.

It honestly didn't look like anything's happening but I can tell Ethan has started his analysis due to the fact that his face no longer shows any signs of uneasiness or nervousness. 

This is not a side of Ethan I see often as he's always a fanboy around me. 

Though when he's serious and working hard, it's like he's a completely different person.

I wonder how he's handling this whole running a school business. 

Probably better than whoever was there before if he's there now and not whoever the guy before was.

or maybe it's cuz the previous guy left. 

As I was thinking about this, I notice Ethan's expression changed from his determined look that he had in the beginning to a much more worried look.

"Hey is everything still alright?" I asked. 

"Oh um... I'm... uhhh... I got some bad news..."

"That's... not what I want to hear..." 

Before I can finish the rest of my sentence, Phanna quickly interjected.

"Let me tell you this, there's nothing wrong with me."

"You say that but, I've never seen any internal structure like yours before."

"I told you aready it's completely normal. My body abnormality detector would have informed me about any abnormalities if anything did go wrong and baring extreme damage, my body will reset to it's normal state. Honestly, I'm more supprised by whatever you did"

"Me?" 

"Ya, I wasn't expecting you'd perform an ultra sound and all without any equipment as well. much less be able to make out anything within this space."

"Ultra sound? I'm not exactly sure what you mean? But I was using my Innate Ability Soprano..."

Phanna chuckled at the comment.

"Well... even if we assume that to be true... I... uhhh... how should we address you?"

"wha?"

"Well You seem to... um... lack any reproductive capability..."

"Oh, I guess Mikay didn't fill you in"

"No this is news to me too" I interjecte.

"You sure are forgetful for such a young person."

Ethan seems to be rather confused at what's happening.

"Me?"

"Not you Ethan. I mean Mikay."

I sighed. "Phanna, you might as well fill Ethan in too and maybe answer his question too while you're at it"

Phanna made a dissapointed face... or what can only be read as a disappointed given the whole stasis disabling body parts business.

Honestly, I still have my doubts regarding this whole stasis thing. 

"Long story short, my I don't have a maximum life span. We call this biological immortality and I'm around 800 years old currently. That's why people of my home arn't able to reproduce and almost all reproductive features are removed from our geneti... I mean, we are born without these features."

"Right..." I do seem to recall being informed about the first part. However, that last part definitely sounds new to me. 

"Then uhh"

"If you're asking about how we procreat, we have a long process of filing out application forms, sending in geneti... flesh samples and having this process done by an authorized third party." 

Ethan seems to be speechless

"Ethan, just ignore what Phanna said, they're prone to rambling about nonsense."

"Hey I'm aliready making an effort here to make things easier for your primitive minds!"
