# Chapter ???

"Oh right, by the way, do you want anything to eat? we should probably visit the market before all the shops closes down for the night. Unless humans of your world have different eating habbits too" Mikay suggested.

"Oh ya, I completely forgot, I haven't had any food today yet. I'll take you up on your offer."

Mikay helped me up onto my feet.

Mikay then walked over to the aquarium where Pillow is swimming around in and grabbed it out of the tank.

"Is Pillow coming with us?"

"Yes, I generally take it out to walk around once a day on most days."

"Slimes are quite similar to dogs from my world it seems"

"Dogs? we have those here as pets too. they're just alot more rare to find in a bigger town like this. They're more common in villages that have to life off the land."

"Really? Why's that?"

"Slimes are just the perfect pet for town life and people generally find them cuter than dogs and cats."

"Uhhh... How is a round blob like that cuter than a fuzzy cat or dog?"

Mikay held Pillow out towards me and looked at me with a grin.

"Give pillow a hug and you'll understand."

I looked at Pillow wiggling around in Mikay's outstreached hands.

I guess it's a new experiance so there's really no reason to turn down this offer.

besides, this might not be the same feeling as what some simulations would suggest.

I grabbed Pillow out of Mikays hands and I immediately noticed that my hands got sucked into Pillow's body.

"gooi gooi"

Pillow's body jiggled around making the "gooi gooi" sound as my hands slid into it's body

I could feel a type of smoothness all over the parts of my arm that slid into pillow.

the feeling was like sticking my hands into some kind of non-Newtonian fluid.

It was also kind of felt cool to the touch.

It felt like it's internal temperature was a few degrees higher than room temperature which was quite curious.

Mikay then let go of Pillow and I was pretty sure Pillow would just slip right off of my hands but instead I felt a tug on my arm.

Pillow seems to be grabbing me as much as I'm grabbing it. 

honestly, it's valiant effort to not fall off of my arms is sort of cute and endearing in a way. 

but it's smooth and squishy surface was definitely it's main charm. 

Maybe I should bring one or two back home with me when I eventually do find my way back home. 

I can definitely see that slimes have a bit of potential as a nieche pet back home.

but then again, maybe it already is and I just don't know it yet since I really haven't looked into pets too much. 

I only really know about dogs and cats but that's it and even those kind of rare in the parts where I lived

Mikay and I made our way through the front door and eventually onto the streets.

This time, Mikay didn't make any attempt to grab me and fly off somewhere. 

I was half ready to jump away if he made any attemt but i guess having Pillow in my hands might make that hard.

I squeezed Pillow against my body and huged it tight like a stuffed animal. 

It squirmed around in my arms wiggling around. 

Supprisingly, hugging it feels quite good as i rested my chin into it too.

My face half sunk into the squishy smoothness of Pillows body as i followed Mikay down the street.

this feels surprisingly good.

Pillow might not be a fluffy pet but it definitely could give the fluffy pets decent competition. 

As my face sunk into the squirming Pillow, I noticed a distinctive fragrence coming from it.

I wasn't exactly sure what it was but it smelled just like the room that I was in earilier without the smelle of wood. 

the only word I can use to describe Pillow's aroma is nostalgic.

I observed the building around us as I walked.

they were basically all wooden boxes with wooden windows that swung out to open.

The roofs were all pretty similar which is one large diagonal slab of material probably wood with straw on top of it. 

The roofs seems to be all pointing towards the same direction which makes me think that the wind often blows in one direction.

The buildings weren't very densly packed with a large patchs of tall grass between each building.

Honestly, I wouldn't even call the path we're on a road. 

In fact it's more like a trail that many people often walk through that the dirt below us is tightly packed enough that walking on it feels like walking on paved roads. 

There were mountains in the far off distance on opposite sides. 

I guess that means that we're currently in a valley. 

That'd make sense as to why this place is called Mountain Pass.

We walked around for a short while as I looked at our enviroment hugging Pillow. 

Mikay and I turned a corner and I found myself walking around a larger path with buildings on both sides

This path is the closet thing i've seen in this world that i could call a road.

Majority of the buildings were pretty much the same as the other ones i saw earlier except they had some signs on them

There weren't many words on many of the signs and majority of them were just pictures. 

"People here dont know how to do read to they" I asked.

"Ya. it's quite rare for regular civilians to know how to read in Mountain Pass. What brought this up?"

"I was just looking at the signs on the buildings, they seem to be mostly pictures."

"Oh? Is the ability to read a common trate in your world Phanna?"

"Of course, it's a part of the required mandatory learning curriculum in my world. In a way, it's the main way of communicating with other people across space and time."

"That sounds rather romantic."
