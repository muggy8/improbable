# Chapter 4

Three days has passed since the first night I've invited Ethan to my home. 

To my dismay, Phanna's prediction did come true.

All three of us fell ill however what Phanna has is much worse than what either me or Ethan is experiencing. 

Though I do feel like what I caught may be comparable to Phanna's

Ethan is currently resting in the living room. 

The other day he insisted that he had to stay around to ensure Phanna's safety which is why I brought a mattress into the living room. 

My past 3 days has been none stop exhaustion trying to deal with my biggest fan living in my place

This decision turned out to be huge strain on my mind and body. 

Well I guess Ethan's probably not actually my biggest fan, but he's about as fanatical as they get. 

I'm not exactly sure how but dispite his fanaticism towards me, he has yet to leave Phanna's side ever since he first came over. 

It's quite admirable honestly.

How he's able to just abbandon his post as the principal is something else the eludes entirely. 

However, I feel like if I were in his shoes in my earlier days, I probably would have done the same.

Despite all this, Phanna is still alive as I painfully made my way over to Phanna's room from my own room diagonally

"Hey you alive in there still?" I meekly called out

"Barely..." said Phanna laying in bed

Phanna's voice sounds extremely out of breath. 

Honestly, so does mine. 

"I... uhhh... I guess I... uhhh... win this round"

This exhausted voice coming from Phanna feels completely alien. 

That said however, what Phanna is saying is completly inline with the character of Phanna I know and tollerate. 

"You're breathing rather heavily there..."
