# Chapter 2: Title in Progress

As I closed the door behind me, I thought about the conversation I had with Phanna

I walked across the hall way to a room labled "Hickory".

As I entered the room to drop off Pillow, I felt a sense of nostalgia hit me.

I walked over to the table by the window on the other side of the room.

Everything in the room was kept the same as they were on the day Hickoy left. 

The undone bed sheets, the random things on the table, even the clothing she keeps in her closest and the half open door on it. 

All kept as the same as they were waiting for her to return one day. 

The only thing that's different is a mini aquarium that i commissioned the other day as the larger one is currently being used as a safe zone for Phanna. 

I put Pillow into the aquarium and cloeed the lid on it to keep Pillow from jumping out.

Of course i don't intend to keep the aquarium here for long. It's the only other room in the house that I can put pillow in at the moment. and as soon as Phanna's safe to explore around, I'm gonna have the aquarium refilled and put Pillow back inside. 

I stood there for a while reminiscing about Hickory growing up. 

I looked towards the drawer that she often puts itmes on display on in additon to keeping her cloathing in. 

Looking across the display, I can recall many fond memories of the time I spent fathering her.

The Mark of a Protege badge she got when she was just 12. Not the record for the youngest Protege but definitely extraordinary. 

beside the Mark of Protege was the Mark of a Master badge she got when she was 14. I can still remember the day she got this and how excited she was to be able to be around me more in the future. The very next day, we went on our first joint assignment together. 

and beside that... a burnt up item, what most would dismiss as trash. But is something that bears heavy on my mind. The Mark of a Grandmaster badge that formerly belonged to Hickory. 

The day she earned it was bittersweet. She had long since been qualified to advance to the rank of Grandmaster but she kept it a secret to stay with me on joint assignments. 

It was also bittersweet for me too. happy that my daughter has surpassed me, sad that I'll likely never reach those heights myself and above all, the motivation to join her in the highest rank.

But that didn't happen...

I still remember the day she left me. Throwing the Mark of a Grandmaster badge into a fire pit and walking off

I distinctly remember her saying "This is not what's right. This is not what the world needs." 

Ever since, I have never been closer to her than the border of her territory. 

Shaking myself out of my reminiscing, I turned around and brought myself through the door and closed it behind me carefully as to not disturb the contents inside.

I used to keep this door open but as time passed on, it became harder and harder to walk past this room without the feeling welling up within me. 

That's why nowadays, I have to keep this door closed.

Walking down the hallway, I came up to the main door leading outside. 

I prepared myself for a quick walk to the town's center. 

I'm quite lucky to still be quite moble even at this age.

I locked up the door and began the short walk to the mastery academy located at the center of town; a place I once teached at. 

Hopefully I won't be too much of a bother showing up out of the blue like this.
