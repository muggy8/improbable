# Chapter 6

Mikay and the other judges made their way to the side of the field as Ethan just kind of stood there saluting the judgeing team.

well knowing what I know, Ethan's not really saluting to the judges but rather just to Mikay.

"This Mikay is kinda a big deal around here I guess" I sighed

Someone sitting beside me herd my comment and leaned in.

This person seems to be a female of their species.

"You don't know who Mikay is?"

"No I know who Mikay is. I just didn't think they're some big deal."

"Hun? didn't you fly in with him?"

"Ya. I didn't even give consent to flying. this is harassment I tell you." 

"Sound serious, but Mikay's a really big deal here. So why where you flying with Mikay?"

"Uhhh... Mikay really wanted me to attend this stupid test thing and I really didn't want to but you can't really say no to someone who can summon tornados on a whim"

"Oh I know that feeling. I was adamantly against attending myself as well since I know I have no chance of beind admited but my sistes forced me to come. By the way I'm Melody, what's your name"

"Name... I guess I go by Phanna now..."

"Well nice to meet you Phanna. I'm an elf. you don't seem like you're from any tribe I recognize. You're like half way between an elf and a foxen."

"Foxen?"

"Oh foxen are demi humans with fox like features"

"Intresting... do all cultures here have such strict divisions"

"Hmm?"

"From where I'm from, all rational entities capable with conversing with at least 3 other human species is considered human since there's too many variations to classify. That means where I'm from, I'm just a human. no other denomination."

"Oh wow that sounds really nice but also really confusing."

"Ya it's got it's ups and downs."

Melody leaned back and faced Ethan again and I followed suit doing the same.

"As stated earlier, this competition is used to determine individual's aptitued and drive. as such this is not like normal fights you may have experianced. the goal isn't to kill but to expel your opponent from the platform you both stand on as we want all perspective students to be in good health when attending classes a month later. Now then lets draw our pairings. would all perspective students please line up to draw your bracket."

Ethan pulled out a deck of cards from his pocket. 

Many of the perspective students started making their way over to Ethan.

I reluctantly did the same 

I ended up drawing a card with 16 dots on it.

If I had to guess, it means that reading and numeracy is a rare skill for people to have. 

Epxected for a culture of this age if the simulations are to be believed. 

Speaking of. why do I understand everyone here. there's no reason that that should be the case if I was summoned randomly from across space-time...

But Mikay did say something about language matching as a part of the ritual... maybe the ritual installed a language pack while summoning me.

"user index installed languages"

_$ 122XJ049RC88OH91_

that's odd I only have 1 language installed... 

I guess I'll have to ask Mikay about it later. 

"Will numbers 16, 15, 1 and 2 please make your way to the platforms." Ethan broadcasted over the students. 

Is it considered lucky or unlucky to compete in the opening round?

Meh it doesn't really matter.

Maybe I should just forfit i really don't see any point in all of this

needless to say I didn't really listen to much of the speech Ethan gave earlier. 

I made my way up towards the stage and found myself looking a highly muscular man who's also got quite a bit of excess body fat on him too. 

He's noticeably shorter than me

"Hey you know this place is no place for girls like yourself" said the man looking up at me clearly trying to provoke me. 

I could brush it off as some primitive idiot who doesn't know any better but today's not that day. 

I was misstreated earlier and even awoken from my beauty sleep. 

This guy seems to be asking for an ass kicking and I have plenty to hand out.

"Oh? And what's a shortie like you going to do to me."

"Hehe that's the spirit I wanna see. I'd hate to injure a poor defenseless little girl"

This guy needs to be put into his place...

I responded with a smerk 

"User load experience showmanship-combat" I announced

_$ loading experience 25%_
_$ loading experience 50%_
_$ loading experience 75%_
_$ experience loaded_

"You what?"

The short man seem to be truly confused but I heed him no mind as I took up my innitiatial stance.

All the movements I mad had this flow to it as if it was well practiced.

but in reality I probably downloaded the entire showmanship experience pack on a whim who knows when.

At lease it's being useful now I guess

The way may body move was almost like it was automatically moving surprising even me though I made sure to not let it show. 

Thought whether I wanted to show surprise or not isn't really a valid concern in this case as the experiance pack also put a pretty big smile on my face.

Using experiances that I did not manually acquire is quite the experiance every time. 

My concious mind has no idea what's happening or what's going to happen and all I can do is trust in the experience pack's muscle memories.

But usually after a few uses, I'd start to get a feel for things.
